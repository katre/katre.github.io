# Up the Beanstalk

## Phase 1: The Beanstalk

The beanstalk grows out of a clearing in the forest, impossibly straight up
into the clouds. The leaves are generally close enough to easily climb, but
visibility is very limited.

Before each encounter, have party make a group Athletics check to climb:

- On a critical success, they get a hint about the next encounter.
- On a success, they climb with no problems.
- On a failure, they fall and make enough noice to force a bonus encounter.

### Encounters

The stalk is roughly divided in thirds:

- In the first third, roll 1d6
- In the second, roll 1d8+2
- In the third, roll 1d12+4

No beans, however.

### Encounters

farmhands are armed with giant hoes and shovels.

people who are 20 feet tall. The castle ha two visible stories and a basement,
which is accessible by a (giant-sized) cellar door on the far side of the
castle.

Because the castle is built to a larger scale than the players, all stealth
checks to hide are made with advantage.
