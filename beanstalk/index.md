# Up the Beanstalk

## Phase 1: The Beanstalk

The beanstalk grows out of a clearing in the forest, impossibly straight up
into the clouds. The leaves are generally close enough to easily climb, but
visibility is very limited.

Before each encounter, have party make a group Athletics check to climb:

- On a critical success, they get a hint about the next encounter.
- On a success, they climb with no problems.
- On a failure, they fall and make enough noise to force a bonus encounter.

### Encounters

The stalk is roughly divided in thirds:

- In the first third, roll 1d6
- In the second, roll 1d8+2
- In the third, roll 1d12+4

## Phase 2: The Cloud Fields

Upon climbing through the clouds (which are wet and clammy cold), the cloud
fields are visible, with the giant castle in the distance. The fields are
planted with all manner of giant vegetables: wheat, corn, pumpkins, tomatoes.
No beans, however.

### Encounters

There are [Hill Giant (CR 6)](https://a5e.tools/node/1639) farmhands wandering
the fields, but they are generally avoidable by stealth checks (DC 10). The
farmhands are armed with giant hoes and shovels.

## Phase 3: The Castle

The castle is, in fact, a giant castle: the doors and windows are sized for
people who are 20 feet tall. The castle has two visible stories and a basement,
which is accessible by a (giant-sized) cellar door on the far side of the
castle.

Because the castle is built to a larger scale than the players, all stealth
checks to hide are made with advantage.

### NPCs

-  [Bonebreaker Tom (a Cloud Giant, CR 10)](https://a5e.tools/node/1633)
   -  Has changed out of his silk robe into a fine suit
   -  Wearing a fine silver necklace (woth 100 gp) with the vault key
-  Mrs Tina Bonebreaker (also a Cloud Giant)
   -  Wearing a nice house dress
-  Mildred, the goose who laid the golen egg
   -  Will honk loudly at non-giants
-  Several [Hill Giant servants (CR 6)](https://a5e.tools/node/1639)
   -  Initially armed with brooms (as Greatclub, but only 1d8+5 damage, chance of breaking)
-  [Ratling tribe](https://a5e.tools/node/2919)
   -  Essentially numberless
   -  Lives in the basement
   -  Constantly trying to steal the cheese from the rat traps

### Encounters

In each room, roll an encounter die. If there is an encounter, roll again to
see which group appears.

-  Servants: A group of 1d4 servants comes in.
-  Tom, Tina: Tom and/or Tina arrives.
-  Mildred: Mildred waddles in. If Mildred sees the players (perception DC 10),
   immediately begins honking loudly.

### Rooms

#### Entry Hall

A two-story room with a balcony, this is where the main door is located. A
stairwell leads to the balcony and the second floor.

Encounters: servants, Tom, Tina, Mildred

#### Dining Hall

A long table surrounded by benches. A fireplace is in the south wall, shared
with the kitchen.

The walls are covered with six tapestries showing the history of the giants
(worth 200 GP each).

Encounters: servants eating, Tom and Tina eating, Mildred

#### Kitchen

Giant ovens make this room unbearably warm. There is a back door and stairs down to the cellar.

Encounters: servants cooking, Tina, Mildred

#### Barracks

Rows of beds for the servants to sleep. Upon searching, find some of the following:

1. A pouch with 200 GP of gemstones
2. A giant-sized deck of marked playing cards
3. Dirty clothes
4. A giant-sized cloak of elvenkind. A master tailor could possibly cut it down to two cloaks
5. A letter from the servant's home: they miss him and want him to return
6. A letter to a rival cloud giant: the servant is a spy!

Encounters: lots of servants (2d6), Mildred

#### Armory

The armory is full of giant-sized weapons and armor. Tom has a set of
masterwork plate mail that would be worth 5000 gp if it could be moved and sold
(weighs 200 lbs).

The Bell of St Olvard is here.

Encounters: Servants, Tom, Mildred

#### Kennel and Mews

Outside the main castle are mews for the [wyverns (CR
6)](https://a5e.tools/node/1823) and a kennel for the [giant hounds (as winter
wolf, CR 3)](https://a5e.tools/node/2008).

Encounters: wyverns, hounds, servants, Tom

#### Solarium

The solarium has had part of the roof replaced with glass, and is full of tubs
of soil growing giant flowers.

There is a [brown mold trap](https://a5e.tools/node/2726) in one corner of the
room: that corner is exceptionally cold.

Encounters: servants, Tina

#### Trophy Room

Holds trophies of Tom's hunts. The walls are covered with the heads of deer,
peryton, and even a young red dragon (worth 500 gp to a collector).

There is a large birdcage here, with a halfling bard (level 3) trapped inside.
The key is in the Bedroom.

Encounters: servants, Tom, Mildred

#### Sewing Room

A large loom sits here, along with many bolts of finished cloth, and a few
dummies with partially sewn clothes.

Thread runs back and forth from the looms. Anyone moving through the room needs
to make a Dexterity save. On a failure, they become entangled in the yarn and
need to extract themselves (or get help). To extract, make a DC 15 check (any
applicable skill), but on a failure the loom is loudly knocked over.

On the far wall is a bolt of silk worth 200 GP.

Encounters: servants, Tina

#### Guest Rooms

Rooms for guests to stay in. Searching yields the following:

1. A pouch with 500 GP
2. An old book in an unknown language
3. A set of giant-sized bracers of archery
4. A bowl of commanding water elementals

Encounters: a guest cloud giant, servants, Mildred

#### Bedroom

Tom and Tina's bedroom. Very fine, giant-sized furniture.

1. Tom's giant silk robe (worth 1000 gp)
2. A large diamond (worth 1000 gp)
3. A letter from Tom's Storm Giant overlord
4. A [bag of beans](https://a5e.tools/node/830)
5. The key to the birdcage in the Trophy Room.
6. A copy of Large Richard's Almanac, useful for planning the planting and
   harvest of giant-sized vegetables.

Encounters: Tom, Tina, Servants, Mildred

#### Vault

Locked, only key is around Tom's neck. The lock is spelled, if someone tries to
force it or pick it, it begins to scream (DC 15 to notice, DC 15 to dispell).

Where Tom stores his wealth: mostly cloudsilver, also gems and gold. Total worth is 10,000 GP.

Encounters: Tom, Mildred

#### Cellar

The cellar is partially storage for everything not needed upstairs, and
partially a pantry for the kitchen. The area is a maze of junk pils and
cloth-covered furniture. Roll Perception (DC 15) or get lost.

The cellar door is very heavy: DC 20 Athletics check to open, and another DC 15
Athletics check to lower it quietly. If either check is failed, the door falls
with a loud booming sound.

The cellar is also home to a tribe of ratlings, who snuck in to steal from the
pantry and stayed. They are constantly moving around, trying to not get too far
from the pantry but also to avoid the traps.

Traps: [ratling trap](https://a5e.tools/node/2794)

Encounters: ratlings, servants, Mildred
