# Up the Beanstalk

## Phase 1: The Beanstalk

The beanstalk grows out of a clearing in the forest, impossibly straight up into the clouds. The leaves are generally close enough to easily climb, but visibility is very limited.

Before each encounter, have party make a group Athletics check to climb:

- On a critical success, they get a hint about the next encounter.
- On a success, they climb with no problems.
- On a failure, they fall and make enough noice to force a bonus encounter.


### Encounters

The stalk is roughly divided in thirds:

- In the first third, roll 1d6
- In the second, roll 1d8+2
- In the third, roll 1d12+4
