# Additional metamagic edges

Sprawlrunners already has several metamagic edges available:

-  Initiate
   -  Greater Initiate
-  Flexible Signature
-  Masking
-  Shielding
-  Spirit Companion

In addition, here are some extra metamagic edges that can be taken.

## Anchoring

Requirements: Veteran, Initiate, Spellcasting d8+

Anchoring allows an initiate to cast a spell and anchor it in place, waiting for a trigger condition before it is cast.

The spell will last for Smarts days before dissipating.

## Enhanced Ritual

Requirements: Seasoned, Initiate, Spellcasting d6+

This metamagic allows for larger groups of magicians to perform ritual magic. Instead of the maximum number of participants equalling the lowest Spellcasting die, if the leader of the ritual has Enhanced Ritual the maximum number of participants is doubled.

### Mass Ritual

Requirements: Heroic, Enhanced Ritual, Spellcasting d12+

If the leader of a ritual knows the Mass Ritual metamagic, even mundanes may assist the ritual. In addition to any magically aware participants, a number of mundane participants equal to the leader's Spellcasting die may roll d4 each as part of the Spellcasting Support roll. As in normal rituals, there is no maximum to the amount of support given.

## Quickening

Requirements: Heroic, Initiate, Spellcasting d10+

Quickening allows a spell to be made permanent. A magician can have at most Smarts quickened spells.

## Spell Shaping

Requirements: Seasoned, Initiate, Spellcasting d6+

With Spell Shaping, a caster can increase the difficulty of a Spellcasting check by 2 to gain:
- Increase or decrease the size of the affected area by one step (small medium blast to large, or vice versa)
- Increase the range of a spell (for example, Smartsx2 to Smartsx3)
- Create a bubble in the area (the size of the next smallest template) where the spell has no effect.


## Sympathetic Linking

Requirements: Seasoned, Initiate, Spellcasting d6+

A magicial with Sympathetic Linking may cast a ritual spell against a target without a material component. Instead, the leader must create a sympathetic component and use that in place of the material component. The sympathetic focus could be the targets' name, written on paper, or a drawing that is recognizably the target.

Using a sympathic link instead of a material link doubles the difficulty.
