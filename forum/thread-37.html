  <p><span style="font-style:italic">Asher gives Quint a call. "Hey, got a research job for you, usual rates. Interested? We think some smugglers or black ops project from Aztech were importing BTLs into Seattle, with a last shipment on &lt;date&gt;. Can you see if you can find any evidence that Aztech being behind it is the case or not the case? And track them back as far as you can?"

Asher says, "oh, right, Emvee reminds me we have part of a ship name, let's see"

Asher says, ""'...toatl'"" </span>

After a few days, Quint gives Asher a call back.

"Yo, it took me a bit to dig out the info, but no worries."

"On the night in question, the good ship the AZT Tlatoatl, Aztlan registry and owned by Aztechnology, was en route somewhere between San Blas, which is departed about 7 days previously, and Vancouver, which it reached the next night.  Obvious inference is that it was near Seattle the night in question.  Checking back with satellite records shows that a ship matching the general profile was about 11 klicks offshore Seattle harbor that night, right outside UCAS territorial waters but well within reach for a small boat."

"The Tlatoatl is registered as general freight transport, and was scheduled to be dropping off a large load of consumer electronics (mostly trid sets and microwaves, according to the manifest) for the Vancouver market."

"Regarding smuggling, I did dig up some notes from Lone Star that they believe the ship has been used to smuggle black-market (ie, untaxed) electronics into the city, but nothing on BTLs specifically."

"I took a quick look inside Aztech's systems, but didn't find any hard dope.  There was one link to a restricted file, but it's in off-matrix storage.  I have a link tag, I can try and decrypt it to find the location if you need."

"Anything else?"</p>

  <p>"Awesome. What do you think's in the file? Cargo information for the ship? But yeah, see if you can find out where it's located, and we'll look into doing some on-site data extraction. Meanwhile, lemme send some nuyen your way -- 1500 sound good?"</p>

Quint replies, "I'm not sure about the contents, but it has something to do with the ship and the date in question.  Anyway, we'd need to get someone on-site in San Blas to retrieve the file, unfortunately."</p>
