  <p><span style="font-style:italic">Yay, we got 'im!

I know we're generally taking a break from this, but since I know katre wants to start us up again 10 years in the future (after taking a RL break for a while), I figured the forums would be the best way to resolve a few loose threads.  Namely:

-Trying to get in touch with S-K again (Sunny?)
-What happened to the artifact Kolmetz stole?  Is it now buried beneath Redmond?
-What exactly happened with the glowing and the astral projecting?  Can we do it again?  Will it count towards the 'metamagic technique' we were going to learn for being Initated?  (that would be A-OK with me, BTW.)
-What more info can we track down for the links to Aztechnology?
-How much XP do we get?  Can we use it as a 'deed' to go up yet another level of magic?

It'd maybe also be cool to do a Denver run on the forums (after a month or two in-game time has passed, say) to get betaware for Sunny (should she want it) and to get my rock.  I'll be staying locally for a while in order to make Emvee's focus, but after that I think I'm free.

In general, I'm quite pleased with the campaign as a whole, and just want to say "Thanks!" to katre for giving me (at least) a fun intro to Shadowrun-land.  This final run had a good structure to it--starting off with 'It can't be this easy, can it?' followed by, "Eeeagh!  It's not!" but having a crazy plan that basically worked anyway.  Realistic that it was us who were able to pull it off, too, since only a small group of crazed shadowrunners would have been suicidal to run towards the center of this Invae nest with naught but a vague hope that Kolmetz would be home and that killing him would solve all our problems.  Fun that it almost didn't, too.  And a nice callback to the almost-worked queen summoning from Portland.

I'm greatly interested in the rumors of GM notes, too.  No rush; just don't forget to show 'em to more than Duchess.

Thanks!</span></p>

  <p>I'm glad you enjoyed playing: despite occasional carping I had a good time running it.

As for the last run:
Sunny and Tony get 5 Karma, just because if surviving being kidnapped by ant spirits doesn't teach you something, it has at least used up some of your bad luck.
Istereth, Asher, Emvee and Thurgun get 10 Karma, for a crazy plan that worked.

Emvee and Thurgun can, if they wish to spend 15 Karma, learn to astrally project as a permanent ability.

Asher, Emvee, and Thurgun can choose to use the last run as a Deed for their next grade of initiation, but remember that that means you don't accept the karma above.

About a week after the run, you all meet up with Quint for the promised beer &amp; story hour.  You tell him a slightly cleaned up version, and he related the following:

Huh, interesting.  A couple buds of mine noticed some activity from the Star in the past weeks.  They've been busting into buildings around town, mostly apartment bricks in the barrens, but also a warehouse down near the docks.  Nobody knows what goes down inside, but when they're done they set explosives and knock down the buildings.  I wonder if they found something at your site that set them on the right track?

Over the next few months, you hear vague rumors about the same type of commando raids in cities around North America.</p>
