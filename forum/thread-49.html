  <p>Just making an official thread for people to prepare spells or buy new stuff for Crumbly or what have you.</p>

  <p>Do we want to use a day teleporting back to town again, so we can sell the crown and outfit Crumbly with the proceeds? Also, we'll need to divide up the rest of the scrolls and decide who'll carry the gems.</p>

  <p>The scrolls we found and identified were: Bull's Strength, Gentle Repose, Spider Climb, Tree Shape, Darkness, Knock, Invisibility.

We wasted the Knock. I'm not really fussy about the other ones -- they seem more useful to wizards or druids than to me. Maybe Spider Climb and Bull's Strength would be useful for Paulie, if the latter works on Grog.

I notice that Gentle Repose is a Necromancy spell; does that mean it's evil?</p>

  <p>You know, while I'm posting to the forum more than I have in the last month, I just noticed something else -- I have a spare traveller's outfit I can give to Crumbly. I won't need it unless I take my armour off, and the chances of that happening are slim unless we have to fight a dire swimming pool.</p>

I don't think that Necromancy spells are automatically evil. Gentle Repose sounds like it's designed to go along with Raise Dead, although I'm not sure whether that means it's more useful to you, or more useful for someone else to hang onto in case we get separated from you.

I assume that Finn should get Tree Shape. I'd be happy with any of the other four; are there any that Ebezar wants to reserve? I think I'd like Invisibility, for the possibility of making sneak attacks with it. Also, Bull's Strength will work on Grog, but it'll only give him an additional +2, since its +4 won't stack with the +2 from his gauntlets. So it might be better to use it on Rosie.

What about when sleeping? "A character who sleeps in medium or heavy armor is automatically fatigued the next day. He or she takes a -2 penalty on Strength and Dexterity and can't charge or run. Sleeping in light armor does not cause fatigue."</p>

Aha, but that's why I took the Endurance feat, which negates that penalty. Call me paranoid, but I don't want any horrible monsters sneakin' up on me while I'm clad in nothing but a sleeping bag.

Anyway, spare outfit if it's needed. I prefer going straight back into the tomb tomorrow rather than taking a day or two to buy things. I could be persuaded otherwise if people feel strongly about it, though.</p>

  <p>For what it's worth, Gentle Repose can be either Arcane or Divine, and the Divine version is not in the 'Evil' clerical domain.

As to equipment, I'd really prefer to get mine back rather than buy more, but this seems difficult.  I'm in favor of plunging ahead regardless.</p>

  <p>Time to pick a direction to push on in, then.

Have we now fully explored everything beyond the chapel's secret passage, as far as we know? Also, have "we" tested more than one archway (to see if they all cause naked elf disease), or is it possible that it's just the one?

In any case, I'm not really clear on what was in the secret passage that Crumbly was stuck in waiting for rescue. Is it the sort of place that's likely to have another exit? (Hmm. There were levers, right? I wonder if they might affect the arches...)</p>

  <p>Also, who was keeping the maps? Is there any scanned-in version that we could look at, to help plan our exploration?</p>

  <p>OK, here's a sketch of a map:

http://strackenz.spod-central.org/~lpsmith/rpg/transcripts/tomb/Tomb.png

It's not to scale, but you get the idea.  Stuff we've messed with:

The blue squares are pits.
A1 (arch 1) leads to the little room Crumbly got stuck in for a while that came out at a pit
G! was the gargoyle
G isthe statue of the gargoyle
H is the black sphere with the hydra
S(red) is the red sphere with the skeleton
N(gold) is the gold sphere with the naga.
green squares are the chests
red ovalish thing is lava

The diagonal passageway to the chapel isn't actually diagonal, but dfan didn't describe it as other than 'twisty', and that placement seems reasonable.

The passage to the gargoyle statue room likewise is actually twisty.

The main (only?) things we haven't messed with yet are:

-the black M at the end of the first corridor (the black mouth)
-The orange M in the second corridor (the door behind the orange sphere with the mummy)
-The bronze N in the second corridor (the door behind the bronze sphere with the nymph)
-The orange archway A3 in the chapel.

Crumbly's pants are due east of that corridor "and a fair bit down".  Perhaps we could check from the lich room to see if they're even further down than that.

I'll note that in addition, we haven't seen a hydra anywhere past the black hydra sphere, nor have we found a naga anywhere past the gold naga sphere.

At this point, the only thing we haven't messed with that's anywhere near Crumbly's pants is the black mouth at the end of the first corridor, and the orange archway.  I recommend we toss stuff through them/at them that we're attuned to so we can tell where they go.

My only other suggestion is that we check if tossing something unconscious through archway A2 (the one where Crumbly lost his pants) sends it to archway A1 (where Crumbly emerged) or to Crumbly's pants.  If the latter, we can knock out Crumbly and throw him through.  OK, maybe not.

On a different note, I'm fine with Crumbly keeping my boots for now; anyone else want to donate equipment?</p>

  <p>Hmm.  Does anyone have a Petrify spell or anything?  And, like, some way to dispel it after a five-minute delay?</p>

  <p>For what it's worth, I'm all for exploring the demon mouth.  We've been avoiding it for the simple reason that it's the obvious way in, and thus the one most likely to lead to certain doom.  But I doubt it'll be all that much worse than the paths we've explored.  We can send a canary in first, of course.  (We do still have a bag of tricks, right?  Mine was lost.)

I'm really beginning to suspect that pants-recovery is a loss.  I mean, if I were a mad necromancer designing a trap that teleports intruders' equipment away, I'd design it to teleport stuff directly to my personal lair where I could look it over and pick out the bits that I liked.  The "a fair bit down" description is consistent with this.</p>
