  <p>So, there's this ring.  When we adjourned we hadn't yet decided what to do with it.  I think a between-sessions Identify would be a good idea, if someone wants to cast it.</p>

  <p>I believe that, trap or no trap, people were interested in opening the last chest while we're all still souped-up on spells.  Rosie, at least, is Enlarged and Cat's Grace'd, so she's up for some more whailing on bad guys.

As far as the ring goes, if it's not a Ring of Protection +1, I will be very surprised.  In fact, I wonder if we could get by with a Spellcraft check from one of our mages to see if our own RoP+1 has the same aura as this one.

I did get hit once, so could stand a heal or two, but in general, I say we pick up the same round we left off, flank the chest, open it, and immediately attack.  Maybe we could even avoid the surprise round.</p>

  <p>If that's how next session is going to start, I guess I can come in late.  Crumbly expects the last remaining chest to be no different from the one you just opened, and you handled that one ably without him.</p>

  <p>I agree with Rosie. Most of the party is also still Hasted, and Grog is still mid-rage, so it seems like it's in the party's best interests to open that other chest during the same encounter.

While there's a chance it could be a generic trap, it seems more likely that it'll be another monster waiting to pop out, so flanking it seems like the wisest way to start:

[code:1:58c4dcf991]
---C----
|......|
|....P.|
|......|
|.E=.G.|
|.=RR=C|
|..RRFK|
--------
[/code:1:58c4dcf991]

First C is Crumbly, P is Paulie, E is Ebezar, G is Grog, R's are Rosie, second C is Clem, F is Finn, K is Kong, and ='s are chests (the lower-right one is the one we're addressing).

Does this seem like a reasonably layout to everyone? Then Rosie can pop the top.</p>

  <p>By the way, the reason we're doing this is that I thought we might be able to finish off this room in the forum, so characters could plausibly rest before the next session.

btw, as far as I can tell, no one actually took the ring you found in the middle chest.  Just FYI in case you find yourselves assuming you had it later on.</p>

  <p>Rosie will pick up the ring (after the gold chest is dealt with, presumably), and on the assumption that it is indeed a Ring of Protection +1, will give it to Crumbly, who, I believe, is the only party member with an appropriate ring slot open.

She'll pocket the crystal box, after examining it for clues (and passing it around to others to search for clues/secret compartments/etc.)</p>

  <p>That arrangement for attacking the chest seems like a good idea. And identifying the ring is a Good Thing as well.

I'd like to propose that we go back to the gargoyle statue and sacrifice the remaining 3 + 1 gems into the statue's hands. The stones fitting exactly makes me think that we were on the right track, but that we have to run through all of the gems.</p>

  <p>I am all in favour of opening the final chest right away, and that arrangement looks good to me. Maybe Clem should swap with Grog, giving me freedom to run over and heal people up if necessary. On the other hand it does make sense to have the toughest guy in front of it.

I'll assume we're swapping Clem and Grog unless anyone objects.</p>

  <p>I disagree with sacrificing the remaining gems.

For one thing, it's impossible.  There are three slots, and four gems.  Putting just one gem in a slot didn't do anything.  Unless something different happens after the third gem, we'll wind up with one unsacrificed gem left over.

More importantly, we've only got one shot at this, and two hypotheses.  The other hypothesis is that there's some other factor that would cause a gemcrushing to have a visible effect, but we don't know what that factor is due to lack of information.  (Putting the arm back was our best guess.)  The point is that if we proceed with the second assumption, we can always change our mind later, after we've explored more thoroughly and failed to find any clues.  But if we just destroy all the gems, we're stuck.  There's no "undo" in the tomb.</p>

  <p>I agree with baf about the gems. We can always try the rest of the gems on the gargoyle later on if we run out of obvious things to do. Until then, there's no point in wasting them without more information.

For the layout, swapping Clem and Grog makes sense to me (if there's a monster in there, it's probably more likely to attack whoever attacks it first than whoever's in front of it anyway). So it looks like everyone's agreed with:

  <p>Grog and Clem switch places and Clem opens the chest.

I'm gong to say there's no surprise round since you were all totally ready for something to pop out.

  <p>The instant that the chest lid is raised, Rosie leaps into action with a blur of limbs.  A few seconds later (as rolled on the mud), four of the snakes lie lifeless, leaving at least five (judging by the picture).</p>

  <p>Clem goes all snicker-snack, including a cleave of his own, finishing off the three remaining snakes (there were twelve to begin with, it turns out).

There's nothing else in the chest besides a lot of dead snakes.</p>

  <p>Holy crap, that's a lot of arrows.

Once dfan's done puncturing all our lungs and stuff, could everybody please post their remaining HP? (Or somebody summarise for everyone, I don't care). Then I can figure out the best way to heal everyone. (I'll probably just use up most of the charges in my wand.)</p>

  <p>1d8 darts per target later, you've taken the following damage:

Clem 5
Finn 5
Kong 28
Paulie 23
Grog 14
Crumbly 0 (not being in the room)
Ebezar 12
Rosie 6

Here's my record of everyone's hit points at this point:
Clem 53/68
Finn 70/75
Kong 30/58
Paulie 23/48
Grog 56/70
Crumbly 41/42
Ebezar 66/(61+18)
Rosie 50/68

Crumbly has requested that no one open the box until he can check it for traps.</p>

  <p>After the box is opened, I think it would be a good idea for Ebezar to use Detect Magic to see A) if the ring has its own aura, B) if the box has its own separate aura, and C) if the chests still have auras. (And what kinds of auras, of course.)

If the ring does have its own, I'll use one of my scrolls of Identify on it.</p>

  <p>It has been noted that the crystal box 'looks valuable', so hopefully it's worth at least as much as half a wand of 'cure light'.  Sorry, everyone.  Also, the skeleton had two huge scimitars, which we should at least check for magic.  Finn uses a scimitar, right?  Could he use one?

Also, to reiterate, I think we should check the aura on the ring to see if it 'matches' the aura on our Ring of Protection +1.  I assume this would need a Spellcraft check.</p>

  <p>The scimitars are way too big to be used by any of you unless you were enlarged yourself.

I'll wait with the results of Detect Magic until Ebezar confirms he's casting it.</p>

  <p>Also, how "gold" is that gold chest? If Rosie was able to lift the lid without straining, I'm guessing the whole thing isn't pure gold (because of the weight). But there might be enough gold in it to make it worth our time and effort to break it up and take a few chunks (since a hundred pounds of gold should buy us enough diamonds for another one-up), assuming there isn't still some magic on it that'd be even more valuable.</p>

  <p>The ring has a faint aura of Abjuration, just as your current Ring of Protection +1 does.

The crystal box is not magic, nor are the huge scimitars.

  <p>To formally state what was discussed onmud:  I'm okay with not having the ring, especially since I suspect we're not going to be able to keep it for very long.  I mean, there's the clue about sacrificing a magical loop of metal.  If we don't see any other obvious use for it, I suggest we try putting it on one of the stone gargoyle's fingers.

Also, I agreed to search the walls for secret doors before we leave the room, taking tens for 36 each time.</p>
