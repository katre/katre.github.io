  <p>After finishing up the roach nest, Ehran takes you back to his home.

"Thank you for your help with this.  Here is, I believe, payment enough, given the circumstances."

He slides a credstick across the table, with 40,000 nY on it.

"You may keep the equipment you have as a part of your payment.  Also, if you want copies of the insecticide bombs, we will provide those, to a reasonable number."

"Now, I will provide the instruction I promised, and you must then leave this country and not return."</p>
