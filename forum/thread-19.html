  <p>Those subvoc mikes were pretty useful on the last gig. I'm going to buy one myself -- probably anyone else who doesn't have one should buy one also.

So I'm wondering if Kolmetz is going to come gunning for us, and if so, if we should try and take him out first. We have to assume he's got Kreiger alive after the raid on the SK place, which is enough to link the hit on the gang back to us. Maybe he won't care, but maybe he will -- I'm not sure how big a deal Thorn was to him. Even if he doesn't care about us now, bad shit is clearly going down, and I'm sure we're going to be seeing him in the future. So maybe we should think about finding someone who wants to pay us for cutting that short.</p>

  <p>O'i thought that Saeder-Krupp would want to know who took out their company.  We know a lot about Kolmetz and about Thorn, which O'i would think they'd be interested in.  Can we get in touch with them through Sunny's contact again?</p>

  <p>Normally this is when I would go to ground for a while, but where's the profit in that? :) I figure I'd be the stalking horse since Kreiger got ahold of me indirectly. If nothing else I'm going to be warning my contact.

However, I bet there are some SK people who are very unhappy right now. I'd like to see what info we can scrape out of their systems before we need to flee. I bet they're sending in the big boys, and I don't want to be around to be interrogated. Better to be on the asking end of something like that :P Anyway, SK might pay nice for info about what we know and for Thorn. I'll find out what I can!</p>
