Autopsy Report of Specimen #2060-157-BH
Dr. Lucas Silenia

Specimen #2060-157-BH (hereafter Specimen BH) was presented
as a caucasian male, approxamate age 25, 190 cm in height and
about 100 kg in weight.  Cause of mortality was initially presumed
to be due to extensive damage to torso and skull caused
by firearms.

Specimen BH had several interesting features immediately obvious
to visual inspection, the most notable being the large compound eyes.
Examination of the eyes showed them to be true compound eyes, similar
in gross structure to normal insect eyes.  Dissection showed distinct
nerve grafts between the compound eye structure and the major optic
nerve.

Also visible on Specimen BH were two small, stunted extraneous
arms located approxamately halfway between the shoulders and the
waist.  Said arms were normally shaped, but only several inches
long.  Although each seemed well-formed, and incision revealed
internal bone and nervous structure, no part of the structures (save
the skin) interfaced with the rest of the body.  This included the
nerve structures.  There is no way these arms served a useful
purpose.

Initial speculation was that Specimen BH was the result of extensive
research into forced cloning, resulting in the new arms (obviously a
test of regrowing limbs in new places) and new eyes (again, a test
of growing organs from a different species).  Under examination,
there was no trace of organ rejection, indicating that whoever
performed this procedure was very skilled.

Unfortunately, 12 hours and 15 minutes after the beginning of
autopsy, the specimen began undergoing rapid and irreversable
decay.  Within another 12 hours, the specimen had decomposed
entirely into a puddle of slime.  Analysis of the resulting liquid
indicated that all of the specimen's cells had lost cohesion, in an
never-before-seen type of deliquescence.

It is unknown why the specimen remained intact as long as it did,
only to suddenly decay.  One probably suggestion is that some
chemical found in the autopsy lab was responsible, possibly interacting
negatively with the specimen's previous medical treatments.

Finally, the cells left were typed and subject to DNA analysis.  About
half the cells were found to be within the normal human DNA range.
The rest were found to be of the genus Formica, although exact species
designation was impossible.</p>
