  <p>So, the end of the last session was upsetting to me on a pretty visceral level, and I'm not entirely sure why.  I can certainly see (or at least imagine) reasonable justifications for all the GM's actions, and I certainly am not posting this to rag on anyone.  But at some point when our capture finally seemed inevitable last night, I got the same sinking feeling in my stomach that I seem to get every time I played 'Diplomacy', and is, in fact, the reason I won't play the game any more.  (Somewhat ironically, it also reminded me of katre's reaction when Ghogg captured the group in Avalon that one time. ;-)  I think I felt betrayed (by what or whom and how, I don't know, really), and I know I felt helpless.

I think a lot of that comes from a disconnect between my assumptions about both the game and the world and katre's assumptions about the game and the world. So here's a (somewhat scattershot) collection of moments where I think tat disconnect may have come up.

-The moment when we heard the second chopper in the distance was probably the moment when my heart sank.  Up until that point, things looked bad, but I believed that with some ingenuity and some luck, we could probably prevail.  After that point, it was all over but the getting shot in the legs.  If the intention all along was for us to get captured, I would have preferred a simple, "So, you all are captured in the night" or possibly,  "Are you OK with starting off captured?" or possibly after we all missed the TN10 perception checks, for us to have been gassed and have that be that.  As it was, I felt strung along with false hopes.

So what were the assumptions there?  Perhaps one of my assumptions was, "In the game, you will either be given a situation you should be able to handle, or something overwhelming."

-I am officially Not A Fan of the Shadowrun Death Spiral, where a M wound means, "You will probably not succeed at anything any more," and an S wound means, "Do nothing that requires you to roll any more."  The problem here is that it *seems* like you should be able to keep doing things.  You're still on your feet, you still get your actions.  They just all fail.  I don't know of a good fix for this, though.  Perhaps instead of +1TN, it's -1die?  Then some actions become actually impossible, and there'd be a better intuitive feel for how many of the rest of your available actions still have a chance.

As it was, 2 stun grenades were just cruel, since it bumped everyone up to +2 or +3 on their TNs.  4 or 5 stun grenades would have been more merciful, in the 'mercy killing' sense.

-It turned out that hanging out just across the border was a bad idea.  This was, I think, a clear conflict of assumptions about the game world.  I was imagining the trope where, oh, like when James Bond is trying to get away from Russian soldiers with uzi's on skis, and barely manages to make it across the border and is suddenly safe.  In 'real life' that'd be dumb; they'd cross 5 feet across the border, shoot him, and drag him home.  But I was imagining this world to be more like the former.  I think this was reinforced by the 'closing the border' scenario, the natural conclusion of which is either 'you escape across the border', or 'you are captured this side of the border'.  I was envisioning a world where we could literally stand on the opposite shore of the Columbia and thumb our noses at the border patrol helicopter, and they would be able to do nothing.

Now, a rival *shadowrunning* group that tried to steal the briefcase back from us, that would have fit into the world as I imagined it.  There, I would have smacked my forehead and thought, "Why didn't *I* think of that?" instead of thinking, "Which what huh?"

-In talking with inky about this, I learned that it's somewhat common in Shadowrun modules to have a bit where the group is betrayed by a Johnson.  It seems this is sort of what happened to us, and I'm not sure what I think about it.  Perhaps, katre, you expected us to open the case when we heard the border was closed?  Or just to ditch it?  I dunno.  Again, if the case has a tracking device in it, it seems fairer to just have the helicopters sweep in when we're five minutes away from the meet (a clear 'we were betrayed!') than it does to go through the whole song and dance where seem to get away but not really.  The conflict of assumptions here probably stems from the importance of Prince whats-his-face, which is little more than a name to me, but seems to be a much bigger deal than I assumed at the time.  Like, it seemed to me that (IC) the reason the border had closed could have been for a different reason than us, even though (OOC) I figured it had to be that for story reasons.

In general, it seems to me that having a Johnson betray the group is a straight Negative Play Experience (to use Whizzard's term), in which Something Bad happens when you do something, leading to negative reinforcement where you end up not wanting to do that something (i.e. play the game) again.

-Finally, there's the matter of the shot-up helicopter.  In my mind, this was a major, major coup against the elves.  And it still has a chance to be, since it's evidence they'll have to leave behind that they were there (if the army helicopter didn't already register on their radar), and would instigate a major international crisis between the two nations.  In terms of 'our actions making a difference in the game world' it would still be nice if this was true.  My belief that it *would* be true probably stems from the emphasis on borders we've seen so far.

OK, that's about it.  Again, I'm not trying to complain, I'm trying to work out what the disconnect might be that made my stomach crawl.  I've been having a blast so far, but the less often my lizard brain kicks in to tell me I'm betrayed and helpless the happier I'll be.</p>

Not quite <span style="font-style:italic">everyone</span>: Emvee got through both of those unscathed, and this probably contributed heavily to my delusion that he still had a good chance to overcome.

I agree with this. Or a few stun grenades and a couple gas grenades, even. (Gas seems harder to dodge.) 

Alternately, surrounding the place with enough enemy agents that it would be obvious from the very start that we couldn't handle them all, rather than initially having a small group break in and engage us directly, might have made the intended ultimate outcome clearer.

In this case, I wouldn't jump to the conclusion that we were betrayed, or even necessarily that the case had a tracking device. It seems unlikely that Ehran is on the same side as the guy who gave us the case, and we presumably might have had a chance if we'd made a direct beeline for Seattle immediately. I'm assuming that it was the couple days we spent waiting to see if Ish could find a way across after us that gave Ehran a chance to track us down. (I have no idea what opportunities schep did or didn't have to try to follow us across at that point.)</p>

  <p>Hmm, I don't think I have a lot to add here, but it does seem like it'd be maybe helpful to break this down into smaller points. I'd like to hear katre's answers too, obviously, but here's mine:
[list][*] Did we screw up getting into this situation?
It doesn't seem to me like we really did -- I mean, obviously the safe thing to do was to ditch the case or not take the job at all, but on the assumption that we want to be interesting rather than safe, it seems like we did fine breaking out of Tir Tairngire and, since we wanted to catch up with Istereth and since it seemed like we'd lost pursuit pretty thoroughly, it seems like it was ok to crash with Fish.

[*] Was this an unrealistic thing to happen? (Using 'unrealistic' in the sense of 'for the Shadowrun world')
I don't think so, but it depends on how big a deal the case was. I thought (and still think) that the case has something really important in it. If that's the case, then it seems like extraordinary measures are justified in trying to get it back, and I'm cool with the SpecOps team (who are, it seems to me, pretty much exactly government-sponsored enemy shadowrunners), and maybe even the border incursion by the army, although it does seem like that is running a big risk of a serious diplomatic incident.

[*] Once it started, did we use stupid tactics?
Hmm, I don't think so. Maybe we should have tried to use the briefcase as a hostage or something, but otherwise I think we did ok - we got hit with a lot of stun grenades, as noted, and that made it pretty difficult to accomplish anything, and we did still manage to take out one guy and probably could have taken out another one or two if we'd been just aiming for that.

[*] Were the SpecOps guys using unfair tactics? ('Unfair' in a metagame sense)
Mrmrm. A little, maybe. They had a really good starting position and setup and (I think) were about equal to us stats-wise, but if the grenades stuff had gone differently it seems like we could have taken them in a fight, and part of that was unlucky die rolls on our part.

[*] Did this go like katre expected? And how much Invisible Hand was involved?
Obviously I don't know this, but I'm assuming, yeah, he pretty much had planned "ok, so when they're sleeping a bunch of elven special forces guys will come and stun them and take them back to HQ for interrogation about the briefcase". I don't think katre was fudging outcomes to make this happen, and (I am guessing) if we had had a clever enough plan and rolled well enough we could have got away, but I do think the situation was intentionally stacked against us.
[/list:u:5ee085679f]
Uh, and having added a lot despite saying I didn't have a lot to add, I want to add a couple more points for the future.
[list][*] For the immediate future, I am kind of guessing the plan is for next session to open with a scene where the elves want us to do something for them in exchange for sparing our lives. I think, mm, I am basically ok with this kind of thing -- it seems like a definite genre trope -- but I'd like to make sure everyone else is up for that kind of thing before we actually do it (assuming that this is what katre had in mind, that is). Because I can see some characters preferring to say "bite me" and take the consequences, I'd rather work it out OOC in advance and make sure everyone is going to be ok with it in-character as well.
[*] Based on what Lucian said, I guess I'd like to have a little group run-down on what the challenge levels are going to be for this game. It feels like most of the things have been on the easy side, with a few exceptions (like Emvee and Tony's heroic escape). I've chalked this up to the death spiral, really -- like, it seems the smart in-genre thing to do is to overprepare and make sure you have all the angles covered because if stuff goes wrong you're likely to end up dead. If folks want to run a more free-wheeling game with less prep I'd be ok with that but then the consequence of failure will have to be lower, it seems like (or maybe it <span style="font-style:italic">is</span> lower and I just didn't realize). We have had a lot of lucky breaks in the past and I am totally ok with stuff going against us some of the time, but, hmm, I think I'd prefer that the stuff we play out should be basically balanced -- like, if the intent was for us to get captured I think I'd rather resolve it in one or two die rolls rather than a painful evening's worth of them. On the other hand, if we just blow some die rolls or make a bunch of stupid decisions and get captured, well, that's the way a shadowrun job goes sometimes. Which is maybe how this one really was, but if so I didn't realize it.
[*] Man, Tony's a sound sleeper. I guess he wakes up in the cell next to us.
[/list:u:5ee085679f]

Oh, and finally, I am absolutely still enjoying the game. This last session was kind of rough, but s'ok.</p>

As the player of one of the characters you're probably thinking about, I should probably say what Emvee's reaction is likely to be if the elves try to get our cooperation:

If they offer us our lives and expect us to be grateful, Emvee will not say "bite me". He will <span style="font-style:italic">think</span> "bite me". He will <span style="font-style:italic">say</span>, "Y'h fine, wh't'vr." Then he will doublecross them (or at least, pack up his gear and make himself scarce, and try to convince the rest of the party to do join him) at the first convenient opportunity. If Circumstances prevent there from being such an opportunity, he will feel bitter and resentful.

On the other hand, if they offer valuable incentive to helping them out -- enough to make up for both not being able to finish the first run and for whatever else they want to put us through -- then he'll warily accept and chalk it up to "some clients are a pain in the ass, but it's better than walking away empty-handed". And of course, you know already that nuyen isn't the only thing Emvee would find valuable. (Note that "his life" is not on that list, because he had that already <span style="font-style:italic">before</span> being captured.)

(Also, remember that this is all just if they actually expect us to help them.)

I'm probably just nit-picking, but while I agree that that was true at the beginning, I think it ceased to be true by the time the third helicopter came down.</p>

  <p>Thanks for bringing this up nice and civilly.  I've been dreading the fallout since friday.

Short version: What happened during the run was that you guys did a good job with getting the case out of Tir, and then threw me for a loop.  In my planning, I had figured you'd head immediately back to Seattle (I hadn't forseen the possibility of the group splitting up, but clearly I should have considered it).  In-game, I tried to make Benny as edgy and nervous and scared as possible, to clue people in that the case was a hot potato, and that you wanted to get rid of it as soon as possible.  If that had happened, then you would have gone to seattle, got the money, and started in on talking to Sunny's contact as the next thing.  Oh, and for the record, Benny is totally unrelated to Ehran, except for having stolen from him.

Instead, and due mostly to the group split-up, you parked right over the border.  So, in my best GM mode, I asked myself, "What is Ehran going to do about this case?"  The answer is (and there's no immediate way you could have known this) that the contents of the case are indeed somewhat magical and that he can do a ritual to track it down.  If it had been delivered in Seattle I'm not sure what would have happened (maybe you would get further drawn into Ehran's power plays with the Young Elven Technologists).

So, we have a group of runners sitting in a house near the border, and an Elven lord who wants his magical artifact back (for you No Myth people, I am not entirely sure what the artifact is.  It might be a powerful focus, it might be some form of evidence about the Fourth World and Tir Tairngire's plans for the future.  I'm kinda glad you didn't open it).  He's going to come get it back.

And then I thought, "Hey! That's kinda cool.  I could work this into &lt;future run I've been planning&gt;, and I've been wanting to hook them up with a really powerful magician to teach them some secrets, so let's go with that."  And that's where I screwed up most.

I sent in a team to capture you guys, and I didn't make it powerful enough.  Which I realized almost exactly too late.  Which is why I then upped it and sent in the second helicopter (yes, that was my thumb on the Scales of Fate.  I'm the GM, it happens, and it goes both ways, so).  What would have been better was to have sent in clearly overpowering firepower, or even just take Lucian's suggestion and declare, by GM fiat, "You're all captured in your sleep."  Instead, we had a long, drawn-out, emotionally painful battle, and I'm sorry.  All I can say is, I'll try not to do it again.

Getting to specific items:  I agree entirely with Lucian.  Things should be either possible, or clearly inevitable, and I did a bad job of managing that.  Which is not to say things can't be hard (Tony and Emvee's run against Ares would seem to be the defining moment of that so far), but in this case I did specifically want you to fail, and I communicated that poorly and handled it badly.

I'm not sure if I've mentioned this, but this is the largest and longest game I've ever GMed before.  Previous experience consists of a couple of one-shot like things in person.  So I'm gradually learning what works and what doesn't, but I'm sorry people got stuck in my failure to learn properly.

I think that's about it on my end.  I'm going to start (maybe tomorrow, maybe later) putting up on this forum what happens back in Tir.  I'll only say that it won't be painful, or permanent, and while there is a run I'd like to do from it, there will be some nice carrots for everyone, or they can just go home.  Ehran isn't a bad guy, just very single-minded about protecting his country and people.

Oh, and about the Death Spiral: I agree that it's very limiting.  Partially, this goes to inky's point, that in Shadowrun overplanning means you haven't planned enough, but maybe we can fix it.  For the next session only, let's try a rule where you can drop your TN by 1 by removing one die, to a limit of TN4 (just to keep from getting ridiculous).  If this seems to work, we'll make it permanent, and if not, we can tweak more.  Sound good?</p>

  <p>We've talked about this since, but I wanted to say thanks for understanding and all that.  You've been a great GM, especially considering this is your first big campaign (which I had not been aware of).

I like your proposal to extend my rule to skill checks in general.  And I have yet another adaptation of it:  you can only use skill dice (i.e. not pool dice) to do the reduction.  As a further qualifier, perhaps this limits the number of pool dice you can add?

In other words, the old rule (which I'd forgotten until inky reminded me) is that if you have skill 4, you can only add up to 4 pool dice for a skill check using that skill.  Under the new rule, if you dropped one die to reduce the TN, you would only be able to add up to 3 pool dice for a skill check using that skill, and so on.

So:  say you're trying to accomplish a task with a skill of 5, and a TN of 8.  You have six pool dice you can add.  Normally, you could use up to five of those dice, and roll 10t8.  That doesn't look like good odds to you, so you drop a die from your base skill to get the TN to 7.  However, you can now only add 4 pool dice, so you roll 8t7.  That's still slightly better odds, and you have some pool dice left over for another action.

I dunno about 'bonus dice', like the ones I get for spells from being a shaman.  I guess you can't use them to buy down the TN, but can still add them to the roll?</p>

  <p>Hmm, we've been sort of skipping the rule on the number of pool dice you can add.  I think we'll leave that as a possible tweak if this gets overpowered, and just stick with the basic 'one point off the TN, one die, down to TN 4' rule for the first try.  We can get exotic afterwards.</p>

  <p>Aside from the limit to the TN, is there a limit on how many dice you can remove? E.g. if you have a roll that's 5t10, can you reduce that down to (-1)t4, then add three pool dice to make 2t4? (Or, to put it another way, add three pool dice to make 8t10, and then reduce that down to 2t4 -- effectively the same thing.)</p>
