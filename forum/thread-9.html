  <p>Hmm, interesting.  I forget, how did we enter the thrice-tenth kingdom last time?  Can we do so again with Matushka in whatever state she is in?

Because I'm willing to bet that we need to go there and find us an antidote.

Luckily Pyotr is here, so we already have our simpleton.  I knew I should have left his Wits at 1.</p>

  <p>Vasili says, "I can't help but wonder what the Snow Maidens themselves would make of this story....  (sigh)

"So to seek out the Thrice-Tenth, or to seek out Snow Maidens, we just start walking into the wilderness.  Maybe we'll get a better idea before it comes to that.  Er, hm, we're already walking through the wilderness, aren't we?  So Charles, you seem like a good story-teller.  Think you could tell this one properly if we need to?"</p>
