  <p>John Estopple gives Sunny a call.  "Hey, Sunny, it's all set up.  You and your group will be providing a bit of security to a friend's shipment.  The driver knows the way, he's done this before, but apparently some of the locals are making trouble recently.  He leaves Seattle tomorrow night, meet at this address at the docks.  It'll be taking the scenic route on its way to San Fran.  Good luck, call me when you get back."</p>

  <p>To John:

"Sounds good. I assume they'll be kelvin with us bringing our own gear. Will we need to bring our own wheels?"

Then I start calling people and seeing if they're up for a run in beautiful Cali.</p>

  <p>And at some point, having heard back from Emvee about the autopsy, I'm going to give John a quick call back:

"John, it's Sunny. I've got more info about the gang that attacked the S-K lab, and it's potentially scary stuff. Find out if there are people interested in buying, and watch yourself. If it's what I think it is, life could get bad all around."</p>

John replies: Gear is expected.  There's room in the vehicle for everyone, but if you want to bring wheels, that's fine.  But remember it's the long way 'round and I don't know how many gas stations the driver is planning to stop at.</p>

  <p>'m working a side proj'ct wi' th'shaman troll guy, but I think I got s'me downtime while 'e does th'labwork, so I think I c'n join up. D'we know what kinda trouble we'll be protectin' 'em from? Theft, kidnappin', suicide bombers? An' is it big cargo, li'l cargo, live cargo...?

<span style="font-style:italic">I try to scavenge up a suitcase without too much of an odor from someplace and pack spare clothes, my computer, the dataplayer and a few trids, some tools, and whatever survival-type gear I've got lying around (just in case).</span></p>

  <p>"Sounds like this run isn't going to exactly be in my specialty, but an extra gun never hurts to have along. We heading back with the driver too, or are we supposed to find our own way back?"

<span style="font-style:italic">I'll pack my regular equipment, including spare clips. Plus some blankets, snacks, change of clothes, and toss a movie or two onto my pocket secretary.</span></p>

  <p>Emvee: "Hey, great! I don't have all the details on the run yet. This is mainly to get us out of town for a bit and down to San Fran, where there's a potential second run waiting for us, and if not, hey, at least we're out of the city. I'll see what more I can dig up."

Asher: "Well, there's a potential second run down in San Fran before we come back. Hopefully that'll be more your speed. Emvee asked me to find out more about the protection run, so I'll check on his question and how we get back to Seattle and let you know."

Then I'll check with John and see if he has more info on the run and the answers to other people's questions.</p>

  <p>John replies:

Basically it's a truck full of ... cargo.  You don't really want to ask what.  It's part of a usual run, I believe, they're just putting on extra security since it's time to renegotiate the "protection" on the land it passes through.  A few guys showing some guns and everything should go smooth.  Once you're in San Fran, call that number I gave you and you can meet with the Johnson about another job.</p>

  <p>"Great! Talk at you when we get back! Let me know if anything turns up with S-K."

<span style="font-style:italic">Into an extra-large duffel bag goes the necessities: the secure jacket, the full-body suit, the Alpha, my radios and subvoc mikes, a mix of minigrenades, a mix of regular grenades, my offensive softs, the sneak softs, a few changes of clothes, and the latest book in Teresa Gabaldon's continuation of the Outlander saga, now with orcs.</span></p>
