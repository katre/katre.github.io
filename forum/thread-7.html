  <p>So!  Game next Sunday at 1:00 pacific (4 eastern) after a bit of a hiatus.

Any preferences about what you all want to do next?  Here's what the NPCs are doing, or would like to do:

-Montegue is heading west to the coast, so he can load up his army on some ships and take them home.  It's probably worth noting that LaVache is this way.

-Tamara is flying back to Gallenia to muster her forces.  She's not sure whether Aleksi is going to be content to rule Rurik without the influence of the Gaius to hinder his plans, or whether he's going to try to strike at other provinces; either way, she wants to be prepared.

-Ketheryna is unsure what to do next.  She's well-liked by the peasantry, and is intimately familiar with the politics of Ussura, and blessed by Matushka, but doesn't think she could successfully lead a rebellion against Aleksi from within Rurik.  She'd go with Tamara to Gallenia to help there, but Tamara doesn't seem to like her very much, and things could get strained.

-Borin has had enough of being a crappy Knias, and wants to slink away.  You've stopped him from doing this so far.

-Pierre has told you all he knows, and has no particular plans.

-The drachen spirit skin wants you to awaken his physical counterpart, the drachen that's been in an enchanted slumber beneath the castle of St. Andresgorod for centuries.  In return, it claims it will submit to being bound to whoever you choose as the ruler of Somojez.  It suggested Ketheryna, but doesn't care one way or the other.

I'll try to pull together a map of Ussura this week and label it so you know what's where, but if you visit http://www.tlucretius.net/7thSea/Maps/Map_Ussura.htm you can see Pavtlow (where you are now), St. Tremult (a bit south of where the bulk of Montegue's navy currently is harbored), Odyesse (part of a northward spur of Somojez, and currently under control of Montegue's forces), and St. Andresgorod (capital of Somojez, and site of the sleeping drachen).

Ideally, I'd like to find something you all can accomplish in not-too-many-more sessions, so we can call the season a wrap and take a break for a while.  Feel free to discuss and/or ask questions about other unresolved plot threads you're interested in following up on.</p>

  <p>Well, Pyotr is pretty committed to heading to St. Andresgorod.  he's not sure who to make leader of Somojez, but if no-one better shows up Ketheryna will do fine.  He could probably be convinced to save it for later if everyone else wants to do something else, however.</p>

  <p>Hey, I managed to do the map already:  http://strackenz.spod-central.org/~lpsmith/rpg/transcripts/ussura/season2/Ussura.jpg</p>

  <p>Well, Charles still wants to go after LaVache, naturally. It's unclear if traveling with Montegue would make that more difficult or merely more interesting, but it seems likely that the opportunity would be lost if we let the Montaignes sail away. That said, I'm also interested in the drachen skin, though. So I'd be willing to do that instead if Charles could be convinced that his long-term goals wouldn't be disastrously set back by it.

I don't suppose there's a good way to do both within the next not-too-many-more sessions, since they both sound like potentially big plots, unless they somehow wound up tying together. But if it could be reasonably worked out, I'd be all for doing LaVache-then-drachen. (Or drachen-then-LaVache, but that seems less practical, based on their relative locations on the map.)</p>

  <p>Well, as I told the GM, Raelynn wants to go home. So towards that end, she will be going with Montegue towards the ships. So if Charles wants to go after LaVache, then he can count on her company.

The biggest problem with Raelynn has been that she doesn't have a real reason for wandering around Ussura and getting involved in its murky politics other than the fact that the people she's with seem to have a knack for causing things to happen. The GM kept her in Ussura by saying that there's a warrant out for Rae's arrest because of Fleur, but I would think having a general like Montegue vouch for her would mitigate pesky things like warrants.

I personally find the drachen skin interesting, but I can't figure out what would keep Rae from not going with the army. And no more warrants for arrest, please. From Rae's perspective, the natural place for her if she stays in Ussura, is to go with Keth, and give assistance as part of the sisterhood.

So my vote is Montegue. If not Montegue, then Keth, with a longing glance at the drachen.</p>

  <p>I wonder if there is any way we could get an excuse to send Ketheryna to Montaigne, since then we could have a thing where we deliver her to the ship. I am kind of in the same boat as Raelynn in general, I think -- the drachen thing is interesting but I am having problems figuring out an in-character reason to want to do it.</p>

  <p>You mean Vasili's charming company isn't enough to make y'all want to stay?

Once things have calmed down a bit, Vasili talks to Raelynn aside from the others for a little.  "Hey, nice job scaring that Pierre.  You oughta know, he risked his stupid butt just trying to find you.  I don't think that changes things, but he does have that much going for him."

I'm fine with letting false Borin leave when he wants, once he understands the risks he's still in.  He can try to take the mouse skin back, or not; not sure which would be better for him.  Or he could continue to tag along, but that's probably not such a great story option.  Okay, so Vasili would like to drag a first name out of him before he runs off.

After the aside with Raelynn, Vasili doesn't much care what happens to Pierre, as long as there's something poetically just about it one way or the other.

Unless a better suggestion comes up, taking Ketheryna along with the party for now seems like the thing to do.  At least she's a fairly cool character and would make a much better hanger-on than false Borin.

And Vasili's main motivation is going to seek the drachen.  But anything else that promotes stability in general would be just fine.</p>
