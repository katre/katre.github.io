  <p>[Wherein the GM scatters plot and information hooks far and wide.]

After the fracas has settled down, Charles comments to Raelynn, "Hey, what do you think happened to the vial that you 'pocket'ed?"

As the group of you have finished off/decommissioned several leaders of the invading force, the animals and snow folk manage to fight off the remaining wolves and soldiers, who make a semi-organized retreat back to Wolf-controlled territory.

Vienne, when she wakes, is rambly, incoherent, and rather inclined to laugh at nothing in particular.  Sometimes when she laughs, her breath is ice-cold.  Breck refuses to leave her side, and ends up feeding her, since she doesn't seem to care enough to feed herself.

Vienne's possessions include two plain gold rings and a gold chain with an emerald pendant.  She was also carrying an old book which turns out to be a journal of one Martin Frobisher, an explorer from the previous century.  It falls open to the following page:

http://strackenz.spod-central.org/~lpsmith/rpg/transcripts/ussura/season2/Frobisher_journal.jpg

A fox chirugeon is sent to attend your wounds, and manages to get most of you fixed up and bandaged properly.  There are two exceptions.  "These wounds are beyond my skill," the fox says to Charles.  "They have the air of sorcery about them."  Later, when attending Vienne, he questions you.  "Was this woman shot?" he asks.  When you say she wasn't, he frowns.  "There is an entry wound very much like a bullet's in her back in the left caudal region," he says, "but no exit wound.  Something may still be lodged inside."  Vienne seems untroubled by this announcement, continuing to hum tunelessly.  Breck's face goes white, and he holds her hand in his trembling fingers.

Pyotr's healing regimen includes chipping a hole in the ice over the river, and then using a 'Banya', or sauna.  He invites everyone to join him, citing the numerous health benefits of such a scheme.  (See http://www.saunahistory.com/sauna_procedure.htm and linked pages for more information ;-)

Nemka, impressed with Raelynn's initial dance and her and Vasili's fight-dancing, finalizes his agreement with you to help against Wolf, and to help wake the drachen Gorynytch.  The animals know the secret glade where the fire berries grow, accessible only by air, and send a snow-bird to fetch one.  Nemka sends Daniele to the Snow Queen's castle to obtain the secret ritual needed to reverse the spell of sleeping that was placed on Gorynytch so many years ago.  With a sigh, she waves at Vasili, melts into a thousand snowflakes, and a gust of wind carries them away.  

King Narimont the Snow Leopard offers his hospitality while you wait for their return, and tells you what he knows of St. Andresgorod and answers any other questions you might have.</p>

I believe you said at one point that Glamour could be used to counteract Porte without spending dice if it was done slowly. I'd like to try that technique on Charles' injuries (under Raelynn's guidance, as she knows more about this than Charles does), to see if it can dispel the magic tainting them. And while that's happening:

<i>"Whatever it is that's lodged inside of Vienne's body is probably the reason she's acting this way. I wonder, with the way Porte acts in this place... when Raelynn <i>caught</i> that vial before, could it have bounced back from wherever she sent it and embedded itself inside Vienne?"</p>

  <p>Raelynn tries performing Glamour on/around Charles' wounds, and the fox re-examines them.  "Interesting.  I believe you've managed to eradicate whatever it was that was keeping these wounds from healing.  They'll still heal more slowly than a normal wound, but you should start feeling better in a couple weeks."

<i>[ussura] inky asks, "what language is the journal written in? Montaignese?  And can we work out where the painted room was/is?"</i>

The journal is written in Avalonian, and chronicles the exploration of a Syrneth ruin in Eisen.  The group was composed of people of several nationalities--Keylann was (obviously) Montaignian, Fausto and Theophilus Vodacce, and a couple others.  The fortunes of the party take a turn for the worse after this entry, with one other party member dying and Keylann being severely wounded.  After that, the journal just ends.

<i>"Your Majesty, do you know if the place where Gorynytch sleeps is hidden or protected? Will we need a map or guide?"</i>

Narimont replies, "The castle at St. Andresgorod that lies over Gorynytch has been expanded and re-built many times since the day he was imprisoned.  Fires and earthquakes have reshaped rooms and passages until not even the original architects could tell you what was where.  These days, an upper room of the catacombs is used as the royal treasury, and that is as low as any human normally descends.  But you should have an ally in this--the spirit of Gorynytch himself.  He wishes to be awoken, and should guide you where you need to go."

Also, I didn't mention yet (cough cough) that Borin gave you his signet ring, a will ('leaving no successor to the throne, I defer to ancient traditions, blah blah.'), and directions to the treasury from his old room, where he used to go at night when the laughing from the drachen got to be too much for him.</p>

  <p>Hmm, interesting.  So we only need to get inside the castle, reach Borin's room, navigate some catacombs to the treasury, go deeper still into the catacombs, and then wake up the drachen so he can choose a new Knias.  Oh, and figure out what to do with the drachen afterwards.

I would also like to interrogate Breck a bit about Vienne and Nicolette -- how long he's been working for them, what he knows about their background, whether he knows anything about their blood magic stuff, whether he knows anything about the weird insect things. I suppose Charles will want to know whether he knows anything about LaVache, too. I'm not sure exactly what we intend to do with Breck, but knowing how culpable he is (or seems to be) wrt Vienne and Nicolette's past activities would be a good start.</p>

  <p>Yeah, interrogating Breck (including about LaVache) is good, although I don't know that he's likely to know anything. Can we try to befriend him, or maybe do a good cop/bad cop thing? (Since it should be obvious now that the stuff he was involved with has really messed up Vienne, suggesting that maybe he might possibly have been on the wrong side...) I'll be happy to play bad cop. Hey, maybe we can dig out the repartee system!

Also, If we assume that time is passing normally here (which I suppose isn't guaranteed), how long has it been since the exploding of the ships? And how long would we expect LaVache (or, on the off chance that he doesn't come himself, his duly appointed representatives) to follow my map without magic? (And likewise, how long would Montegue's army take, assuming they want to join the ambush?)

  <p>Breck is pretty sullen, and doesn't respond to attempts to Intimidate him at all (you get the sense that if he didn't have to stay here and take care of Vienne, he'd just walk away), and only mildly responds to cajolery.  You manage to get that he was indeed born Innish, that his parents died when he was young, and learned how to fight on the streets of Wexford.  He got a break when he was 19 when a ship's captain hired him as a guard on his ship, but the captain was swindled by a Vesten merchant, and the captain was forced to sell the ship and let the crew go in Kirk.  That's where he met Vienne and Nicolette, who were nice to him, and he's been with them ever since.  But he won't tell you about what it is they've been doing.  He tries to conceal it, but it's pretty clear he thinks that if he tells you anything about that, you'll use it to hurt them somehow.  "It's time for Vienne's dinner," he says, glowers at you, and lumbers off.

<i>"Can you tell us anything of Gorynytch himself? He will, I hope, be grateful for us waking him, but I am not sure how far his gratitude will extend .. do drachen desire anything except food and treasure? Will he bow to the will of Matushka again?"</i>

"Any agreement you make with his skin will be binding on Gorynytch himself, though you must be careful about loopholes.  He comes from the Old Drachen from before the Age of Man; the Drachen that now live in Eisen are but pale shadows of their once-mighty race.  He is intelligent, ruthless, and cunning, but honorable and, perhaps, a little desperate."  He rouses himself, and goes to survey the animals and the now-abandoned area where the snow people have had their dances in the evenings.  "We may wish to solidify the alliance further by negotiating directly with the skin.  He may have things we wish of him, and we things for him.  Shall I call him to come here to finalize the agreement?  He may or may not come, or be able to come.  But I believe it would be worth it if he did.  I'm afraid I have been worrying too much about Wolf to spend much time on your own noble quest."

<i>"We've seen before that time here and time in our world do not always flow together. Is there a way we can tell how much time is passing there while we've been here?"</i>

"While Matushka at times would cause time to flow differently here than in your world, nothing has happened like that in some time.  She may not be able to directly manipulate time now, if, indeed, she still lives at all in some form.  Long ago, she set her kingdom to not map directly to your world, but to intersect at places of her choosing, and that still remains, to those who know the ways.  But time was not something she manipulated lightly, or often."

[It's been, hmm, maybe a couple weeks since the exploding of the ships, most of which was spent in St. Tremult recovering.  You were in the 3x10 a day and a half before the dance/fight, and this forum is covering things happening in the 2-3 days post-that.]</p>

  <p>As per channel conversation...

Raelynn suspects that whatever is inside Vienne is Porte-related, so she decides to visit her "shadow" world - which is really reality from the thrice-tenth kingdom instead of her normal shadow - to see what she can find. She concentrates and steps through the fabric, and steps into the shadow world. Once there, she scans the skies to see if she can identify anything that would be located inside Vienne. Did the vial she "caught" earlier stay in this world? Is it lying around somewhere? Or has it bounced into Vienne?

Also, (perhaps before she steps into the shadows?)

Raelynn makes a few sketches, from memory, of Nicolette, and of Vienne and gives them to Breck as a peace-offering. She mentions how her magic made Charles' wound start healing better, and promises to use her magic to try to help Vienne, but also adds, "If I don't know what she and Nicolette were working on, I can't figure out what I need to do. If you don't help me, I won't be able to save Vienne! Don't you want to make her whole again?"

She also makes time to smile and flutter her lashes at Nemka whenever she sees him.

Raelynn is surprised that Pyotr took a bath, and offers to trim his beard and give him a haircut.

Raelynn also checks Vienne's possessions (the jewelry?) to see if any of them are blooded. She also takes a look at Vienne's "bullet wound" to see what it looks like. Is there a sense that the same kind of magic is "tainting" it like the one that tainted Charles' wound?

She also "drops" the bug's arrowhead from her list of blooded items, and washes the Ussuran coin, leaving her with only two blooded items for the moment.</p>

  <p>Breck is mollified by the sketches, but is still not quite convinced you all don't actually want to hurt her.  An examination of the wound reveals that it does indeed remind you of Charles' scars.

One of Vienne's rings does indeed turn out to be blooded.  You probably would have missed it if it wasn't blooded in exactly the same spot you blooded your own ring (apparently one of the few spots on a ring that doesn't get regular wear).

Finally, stepping out of the 3x10 into the real world, you find yourself on what seems to be the same mountain, but pretty far away from where you were last time.  The mapping of the 3x10 onto the real world is apparently pretty stretched in this area.  After much searching, you *finally* manage to find a small vial of blood, buried in a snowdrift.  It's cracked and now only about half-full.

When you step into the real world from next to Vienne and peer closely, you do indeed see a faint shimmering, like the 'middle' of the Porte holes you saw when you stepped through the first time.  It's had to make out the exact shape, but it's vaguely the size of a clenched fist, and seems to pulse rhythmically as you watch.</p>

  <p>While in the real world that's Raelynn's shadow world, Raelynn explores a bit. Where is she, exactly? Any chance we've cut cross country and come to the drachen's mountain? Or the mountain where Matushka's daughter lives? Is this the mountain where the original meeting with the snow maidens happened? She leaves the ring in the hole of the tree (she checks, it's still there) so that she has that to guide her without getting lost.</p>

  <p>Here is a question for the gentlemen.

Is there any reason I *shouldn't* heal Vienne's heart? She will still have a heart-injury, but at least her heart will stop being a Porte hole. It might make her less crazy. But I guess less crazy is more dangerous.

Here is a general question, though. The big hole shrunk eventually and then disappeared, just like all the other small ones, right? So that would mean Vienne's heart-hole should shrink and eventually disappear. Or is it that her blood is keeping the hole open? Does that mean the vial I am holding contains Vienne's blood?

Charles? Do you have Chemistry in your repository of knowledge? (I have only natural philosophy of 1)

[ussura] Duchess asks (of lps), "and the other question - is there any means of knowing if it's vienne's blood on that ring? or if it's someone else's blooded item that she is holding?"</p>

  <p>I think since we are the good guys we have to try to heal her, but if her heart has actually been *turned into* a porte hole it may not work (but hopefully, since the healing is gradual, we can tell that we're dissolving her heart and stop). And yeah, I dunno what the deal is with the heart not closing, but having it feeding off the blood would makes sense.

It seems like Nicolette and Vienne probably would have swapped blooded items, but that doesn't say anything about who this particular one belongs to.

Also, if folks are amenable, we should probably go ahead and call up the spirit skin (at least, it seems like it would be nice to get a deal ironed out before we play next). It seems like the things we want from Gorynytch are:
  1) Give the spirit skin to a person of our choice so they can be Knias and repair the political structure
  2) Help us fight against Wolf and Aleksi 
  3) Help us fight against LaVache's guys, maybe
  4) Not run around eating villagers now that we've woken him up

I'm not sure exactly what we can offer in return, though.
  1) Getting the spirit skin back so he won't die
  2) Staying on Matushka's good side (this is of dubious value, depending on how much Matushka sticks around)
  3) Uh -- ok, this is where ideally we would come up with something Gorynytch actually wants. Hmm. What if, assuming we manage to crush Aleksi's rebellion, we make the rebels pay tribute to Gorynytch (or, rather, to the Gaius, who in turn agrees to give something to Gorynytch in thanks) in the form of sheep or cows or gold or whatever else he would like? That probably won't work indefinitely but it would probably be good for a couple decades.</p>

  <p>Short of a forensics lab (or watching someone actually use it), you can't tell whose blood is on the ring.  (Or even if it's 'active', really--you can just tell that there's blood on it and that it was blooded by a Porte sorcerer at some point in the past.)

[OOC, It does seem reasonable that there might be a way to expand Alterna-Porte such that you can start to tell things about other people's blooded items (i.e. a new knack).  You would have to spend time doing one or all of experimentation, research, and/or finding someone to teach you.]

It does certainly seem to be blood in the vials; whose blood is, again, unknown.

Exploring around the real-world mountain, you eventually conclude that it's not one you recognize, though you explore it well enough that if you were to see it again, you'd know.  Based on the climate, you figure that it's probably part of die Drachenbergen range, or the west end of Gora Bolshoi (see http://strackenz.spod-central.org/~lpsmith/rpg/transcripts/ussura/season2/Ussura.jpg )

  <p>Vasili does not seem greatly concerned that Daniele had to leave so soon.

"So that blood could be Nicolette's.  I'd rather see the ring washed than find out."

"Raelynn, I guess once we leave the Thrice-Tenth, you could step into the shadow world and figure out which way the 'path' to that mountain is, right?  Although if it doesn't seem to be Ostrog, maybe it's not so important after all."

OOC: For Vienne, I had been thinking of invoking that rule "if you never want to see an NPC again, but it would be OOC to kill them, just say so."  Hand her over to Montegue, good riddance.  But if she's insane and seems harmless, this might get interesting again.
IC, Vasili hasn't commented much about the diagnosis and speculation about Vienne, other than making a few mean faces.  But maybe Breck's obvious concern is starting to soften Vasili up.

I think what we really want with the Drachen is to convince him it's in his own best interest to help out Matushka (or her granddaughter, if Matushka can no longer be helped) and the people of Somojez.  A friendly goddess and flourishing society means good and interesting Kniases to partner with in the generations to come, right?  That would go a long way toward the not eating people, accepting a competent ruler like Ketheryna, fighting against Wolf, and even a bit of help on our next mission.  Of course, it's still a good idea to get some concrete promises out of him at this point.

Also (to anyone who has an opinion, but especially Narimont), once bound, would the new Knias have some degree of control over Gorynytch?</p>

  <p>Also, remember that if we don't wake the drachen, Gorynytch is going to die.  That's a pretty good motivator.

My list of demands is pretty much the same as inky's, except I don't see any need to pay tribute.  Ideally we'd put the drachen back to sleep.  Maybe with a double-cross? Can we just cancel the sleeping potion temporarily?</p>

  <p>Narimont ponders your question.  "Control?  No, not control.  Understanding, though, that goes both ways.   There have been Gaiuses who learn my ways quickly, and who know what I will agree with and what I will not.  Some of those sought to manipulate me, while others sought to work in concert with me.  Other Gaiuses have been weak-willed, and sometimes it is only my own manipulation of them that has kept this country together.  Still others have honored my visits as one might honor a diplomat, but have led the nation their own way, and let me rule here as I would.  I know this Ketheryna, and if any in Ussura might understand Gorynytch, it is she.  But his ways are old, and his thinking is not the thinking of men.  I would not envy her the task."</p>

  <p>Raelynn decides to try to cleanse the Porte hole in Vienne's heart in hopes of at least helping her get on the road to recovery.

(I agree with Vasili's invoking the rule to get her off-stage)

She also washes the ring to prevent Nicolette from using it to get to them, and also pockets the rings and the pendant for future reference. (Were there any markers or identifying characteristics on the jewelry?)

And about the Gorynytch, here are the things I think we should present:

Keth as the new knias
We tell Goryntch that we will give Keth the sleeping potion as insurance for good behavior. The drachen/Gorynytch starts ravaging the countryside or terrorizing the peasants, Keth puts the drachen back to sleep. This way, we also guarantee that Keth is the new knias, since if Gorynytch doesn't agree, she will just put the drachen to sleep.
(We better make sure Nemka and the Snow Leopard can help us get the sleeping potion)

I don't think Gorynytch would help us with LaVeche. It's not an Ussuran matter, after all, and he has a lot to do to repair his political society to bother with anything outside of Ussura. I do think that he will help us with Wolf, as long as we ask, since it's in his interest to not have one animal dominating the others. Since the GM said that his ways are old, clearly, we need to present to Gorynytch/drachen a petition in the old style, asking for help, giving him honor and humbly requesting his services (We ask permission to allow us to ask you to help us...)

[#crows-nest] If we are talking about tributes, can we offer virgins from the village? Although, I was thinking, if Keth is the knias, we don't need virgin *girls* - i think she would enjoy nice strapping men.</p>

  <p>I agree that it's worth trying to heal the heart and watching what happens. Charles can try to assist Raelynn, in case two Glamour mages are more effective than one. (And my Natural Philosophy is only 1 as well -- although, I might as well try an Alien Anatomy check regarding the heart, to see if it reminds me of anything I saw inside the bug: )

<i>[7thsea] Charles rolls 5k3: 8 4 3 1 3 | 15</i>

It seems to me that now is the time to make a deal with Gorynytch, since right now we hold all the cards: if he's not going to play nice, then it's not in our best interests to wake him up. Plus, instead of trying to guess if there's something else he wants, why not just wait and see if he <i>asks</i> for anything more? I mean, getting to survive is a pretty good incentive by itself, really. As for helping us with LaVache, I was thinking that he might be interested just on the grounds of being pro-Ussura, while LaVache and his company are pretty clearly enemies of Ussura. Plus, if Gorynytch <i>does</i> want humans to snack on or keep as toys...

<i>Charles asks, "Will Gorynytch himself be able to lead us from the Thrice Tenth Kingdom back to Mount Adresgorod in our world, or will we need another guide?"</i>

(If Gorynytch can do it, then that's another good reason to call him now.)

Also, I agree that Vienne-as-villain has had enough play (at least, now that we've defeated her for real). Powerless Vienne is, IMO, a fair way to keep her around as a potentially useful plot hook/insight into the bug/Porte thing, but without having her as an annoying recurring villain with obnxious powers. 

Oh, and regarding the whole notion of carnivores and herbivores in the Thrice-Tenth: wasn't our <i>very first</i> encounter here about that? Charles met Sivka when he saved him from the hawk. (Although the Narnia solution of "good talking animals only eat dumb animals" makes perfect sense to me.)</p>

  <p>[Tackling the Vienne situation first; Gorynytch to follow:]

So!  You gather around Breck and Vienne, and explain to both of them what you think is going on, and what you're going to try to do.  Vienne continues to ignore you, humming the same 5-note tune over and over.  Breck looks pretty confused, but nods in agreement.  Unsure exactly how to proceed, you eventually decide you'll both use 'Jack' to transform an object placed as close to Vienne's heart as possible, similar to how Raelynn and her teacher repaired the Porte scar Fleur made at the cliff in Breslau.  You choose a small stone from the riverbed, and each kneel on either side of Vienne, holding the stone to her chest.  The others (and Breck) stand by, watching.  Vienne continues to hum.

With a nod at each other, you focus on the rock, imagining it changing into cheese.  But... something's resisting.  It won't change!  You concentrate, and redouble your efforts.  The rock begins to take on the faintest tinge of orange...

Suddenly, Vienne's eyes fly open, and she gasps, "No!"  She looks at you with the first sign of comprehension she's had since the fight, and her eyes are filled with rage.  "No!" she screams with a cold, inhuman voice, and seizes your arms, to pull them away from the stone!  Breck leaps up, crying, "You're hurting her!"  His fist are balled, but he pauses, briefly stymied (but only briefly) by having to decide which one of you to punch first.

<i>Anyone who wants gets one action before anything else happens.  Charles and Raelynn: Finesse check to see if you can hold on to the stone (TN 20).  If you succeed and want to keep trying to transform the stone, roll Jack+Wits.  The total will be the sum of your two scores minus 15 (or, to put it another way, whatever over 15 one of you rolls, added to the other's score).</i></p>

  <p><i>Charles struggles to keep his grip on the cheese-to-be while he glaring at Breck. "Stop being a child. Can't you see that something has a hold of her?" He looks at Vienne, then back at Breck. "Look in her eyes. That's not the Vienne you know. Do you want  us to try to bring her back or not?"</i>

  <p>"Sure--if you want to try to help this action, it'll be -10, since both Vienne and then Charles are between you and the
stone.  If you first touch Charles, -5, and if you manage to get the stone again, -0, though either of the latter two will affect your roll the next action.  (In general, you feel it might take a few actions before it completes the transformation.)"

  <p>...Right down on Vienne's head, sprawling her out onto the snow in a most undignified posture.  "Do what you have to do," Breck says sadly, and Charles and Raelynn again put the rock to Vienne's heart, and try again.  Without interference this time, the rock finally transforms, and the two of them sit back, breathless.  Vienne gasps, and then relaxes, breathing slowly at last.  Breck sits down and puts her in his lap.  "Sorry, V," he mumbles, brushing her hair with his thick fingers.  Then he sees the cheese.  "Oh, hey!  Dubliner!"  He grabs it and munches happily, Vienne curled up, asleep, in his lap.</p>

  <p>The day the two groups are due back with the materials for the waking-up potion, Narimont calls together a meeting with your group, Nemka and his cohorts, and he and members of his own court.  He sends an invitation to Gorynytch through his own channels, and the group of you prepares for travel and negotiations.

That evening, the spirit skin of Gorynytch does indeed show up, and you gather on the banks of the frozen river Tambov.  Here in the thrice-tenth kingdom, you see him more clearly for the first time--he's still fairly indistinct, but you can tell he's over 120 feet long (almost twice the length of 'modern' drachen, if the tales are true), though like modern drachen, he also does not appear to have wings.

Negotiations proceed fairly smoothly--they're a bit slow, as it's clear that Gorynytch is used to thinking at a much slower pace than is typical for humans (or animals and snow folk, for that matter), but his anxiety about wasting away to nothing is a good motivation for him to speed things up.

In the end, Gorynytch gathers himself and proclaims:

"So!  If this group of humans wakes us, we agree to limit our meals to the Dumb Animals, and to leave Humans, Talking Beasts, and the Snow Folk alone."  He grins.  "You all have come far since the old times.  I salute you."

"In addition, I myself shall agree to bind to Ketheryna, giving her a legitimate claim to the Somojez throne.  Though we will not fight Wolf directly, we will work to keep he and his forces from Somojez, and will assist in evicting or destroying any threats to Somojez, as determined by its ruler.

"If we are awakened, we shall enjoy the Favor of Matushka, as well as can be accommodated by her representative, Narimont.  The talking animals and the humans shall not interfere with our hunting, and the snow folk shall avoid die Drachenbergen, as the range is now called.  And..."

"Oh, great," thinks Sebastien as the spirit pauses for effect.  "Here's where he tries to amend the deal to get some new concession.  This is the same thing that killed the treaty of Reims when I was a junior diplomat."

"The grove of fire berries shall be destroyed, and we shall take Wolf's place, and be the new Second Beast."</p>

  <p>[Ha, excellent.  <i>throws Vasili a drama die</i>]

You gather with just Narimont to discuss this; Nemka shrugs, as the new bits don't affect him.  Narimont says, "It's certainly possible.  Wolf abdicated his position by his actions when he attacked Matushka.  In theory, he could be replaced, though a ruling council of three works as well if not better than a ruling council of four."  He pauses, thinking.  "The tricky part is that all of the other three are missing.  They left for various reasons, but none have yet returned, and none seem to know their current whereabouts.  Until they return, with just him on the council, his word would be, in essence, law.  Not that there's often many decisions to be made, and they'd be temporary until the full council meets, but still--this is how Wolf was running things for the last several years, and is why he is in such a good position now."</p>

  <p>"Hmph.  If getting that position pretty much means there's no checks on what he can do, that's not really going to work, at least not right now.  He wants to join the Three Beasts, let him re-earn Ussura's trust himself.

  <p>"He can't do <i>much</i> worse than wolf is doing, I should think. But I agree with Sebastien. I wonder if there's anything Gorynytch can do to help us with finding them?

"Speaking of help -- since he's making extra requests (as if saving his life weren't enough), maybe we should ask him to help us deal with L-- I mean, with those treacherous Montaignes who tried to betray Montegue. If my plan works, a forty-yard drachen would make for a nice ambush when they arrive."

  <p>Narimont replies to Charles:  "Well, he has agreed to help against 'threats to Somojez', as determined by the ruler, or Ketheryna.  Was there something more?"  He also ponders the fire berry question.  "The berries have not, to my knowledge, been used for at least two centuries.  But they do form the centerpiece of a few obscure rites, such as the one we are attempting now.  I would rather they be available, should the need arise, and give him some other assurance we will not attempt to put him back to sleep."

(to Sebastien)  "I won't go into our politics now, but suffice to say that while I am King here, like the Gaius, the Four Beasts occupy a position similar to the Knias Douma.  There are conflicts to resolve between the beasts and between beasts and humans.  Sometimes a Knias has a request of our council, and we consider whether to honor it or not.  There are things to protect, and errands of Matushka to carry out, which grant considerable status to those who can accomplish them."  He sighs.  "The Beasts are not, as a rule, obsessed with power.  But the Old Drachen were, and Gorynytch seems to be no exception."</p>

  <p>When we've finished discussing, Sebastien returns to Gorynytch and bows. "We accept the agreement you propose, with the following emendations:

First, we cannot agree to destroy the fire berry grove -- it is a tradition older than we are, and we have great respect for old institutions (nodding to the dragon). But we will agree that so long as the agreement holds, none here will brew the sleeping potion from the berries, or attempt to drug you as you were drugged before. 

Second, we agree to support your replacement of Wolf as Second Beast, but we stipulate that it will not occur until we have found and spoken to at least one of the other three beasts of the council.

Finally, before we awaken you, we require that you agree to bind your spirit to Ketheryna and to her heirs as she designates, that you support her claim to rulership of Somojez, and that you permanently renounce any claim of your own to rulership of Somojez or any other province of Ussura."</p>

  <p>"Not good enough!" the drachen skin huffs.  "If you so wish it, the berry grove can be left alone.  But you must agree to protect the grove against those that would use it against me, and, should that fail, that the descendants of the humans, animals, and snow folk here must wake me again within the year."

"As for your stipulation on the second, it is acceptable, with the caveat that such contact must be attempted with due diligence in a timely manner.  Say, within the year."

  <p>Charles pulls Sebastien aside for a moment. He says to him quietly, "I remember something Raelynn said earlier, and it makes a lot of sense. We can give Ketheryna the responsibility for protecting the grove. That way, Gorynytch knows it's in safe hands, and <i>we</i> know that she'll have access to it in case he changes his mind."

  <p>[Assuming the above negotiation proceeds basically according to plan.  Sebastien in particular is still nagged by *something*, but can't seem to put his finger on it.]

A few rounds of negotiation further, you finally have an agreement.  The details are as you negotiated, and the drachen proposes the following oath to seal the agreement:

'We, the present humans, the present beasts speaking for the kingdom of beasts, the present snow folk speaking for the Ussuran snow folk, and the spirit skin of Gorynytch, speaking for both he and Gorynytch himself, do agree to the following in the name of Matushka:

That should these humans wake Gorynytch, Gorynytch will limit his diet to the Dumb Animals, as agreed; that the skin of Gorynytch shall be bound to Ketheryna, and that all present shall support her to rule Somojez as Knias, as agreed; and that Gorynytch shall actively defend Somojez from intruders, particularly those designated as such by Ketheryna, as agreed.

Furthermore, after Gorynych is awakened, Gorynytch shall be known as the Second Beast, under such terms as have been agreed; Gorynytch shall not be put asleep again, and, if so, those present or their descendants shall wake him again, as agreed; Gorynytch shall enjoy the Favor of Matushka; the talking animals and the humans shall not interfere with Gorynytch's hunting;  and the snow folk shall avoid die Drachenbergen."

The details sound fine to all of you (if not *exactly* what you had hoped for), but there's something about the wording that continues to bug Sebastien...

[I suppose I should note that the 'as agreed' language is fairly standard in such oaths, Narimont tells you.]</p>

  <p>The drachen laughs at your proposal.  "And, should you fail, and in some century distant, some other should wake me, shall I be bound by what we agree on today?  I think not!  I shall do what you wish should you--or any here present, if you like--wake me, but not otherwise."

  <p>"Seems like if he pulls some trick, we would want to just revoke the deal anyway, so no big problem if using the berries or failing to wake him ends the agreement, right?"

Vasili looks slowly (mouthing the words) over Sebastien's written copy of the current proposal, looking for the 'catch'.

"Hmm, can we change it so that 'the Knias of Somojez' identifies the intruders rather than just Ketheryna, so that it's a more lasting agreement?  And he's promised to not eat innocents, and to attack certain invaders of Somojez, but nothing about *not* attacking anybody for reasons other than eating.  Maybe add something allowing the Knias to specifically protect certain persons or groups?

"The part about interfering with hunting is pretty vague, don't you think?  And impossible for us to guarantee, if he wants to be picky about what counts as interfering.

  <p><i>"Seems like if he pulls some trick, we would want to just revoke the deal anyway, so no big problem if using the berries or failing to wake him ends the agreement, right?"</i>

Narimont replies, "The problem won't be if he reneges on his agreement, the problem will be if he gets us to agree to something we don't want to do, or finds a way to get his side of the agreement to not be what we think it is."

[Also, 'Knias of Somojez' would be fine; Narimont thinks that would be implied by the 'as agreed' bit.  We can also say that the not rampantly attacking random innocents was also included in the 'as agreed' bit of the 'limited diet' clause.  The details about hunting were also hashed out earlier, so everyone knows what they are.  The Favor of Matushka thing seems to be a Beast concept; Narimont explained it as best he could, and you all mostly followed along.  Without her physical presence just now, it's something that Narimont himself can grant, and is willing to.]</p>

  <p>"As always, Gorynytch speaks wisely. It would be unfair for anyone here to be bound by a contract they did not agree to, or gain terms they did not earn. So let us revise: if we wake Gorynytch, he shall limit his diet to the dumb animals, and bind his skin to Ketheryna, [and the other provisions mentioned above]; and in return for this, if <i>we</i> wake Gorynytch he shall be raised to the status of Second Beast a year from the date of his waking, or as soon as we find Bear, Cat, or Firebird." 

Sebastien pauses. "Naturally, Gorynytch is free to make terms with others if these do not suit, or to remain asleep as long as desired."</p>

  <p>Vasili whispers to Sebastien: "Any time you feel like you have some room to press, you might try changing things so one of the Beasts has to agree to Gorynytch being Second Beast, rather than just being informed of the situation."</p>

  <p>Gorynytch laughs heartily.  "Well done!  Very well, I agree to your newly-revised, greatly reduced in efficacy terms.  Heh heh heh.  Sure would have been nice, though."

You hash out the final clauses (he does indeed agree that at least one of the Three must approve him before Narimont makes it official), and gather to recite the oath.  The sun is setting as you begin, and the sky and snow are tinged with purples and reds.  Nariomont smiles, and says, "An auspicious time."  

You finish reciting the oath just as the sun disappears behind the mountain, and an ice-cold wind whips through your circle, as if to finalize the deal.  Narimont declares, "It is done.  Gorynytch, should these succeed in their mission, I will welcome your return."

Gorynytch bows as formally as one can when one is a disembodied spirit skin that you can only half-see.  "And I welcome the chance to interact with the new face of Theah.  You proved yourselves worthy opponents when you managed to put me to sleep those many years ago, and worthy of being equals by your negotiations today.  May you prove yourselves worthy allies in the future by waking me.  And now, as it will take me longer to drift than it will take you to walk (he nods at the group of you), I will take my leave.  I wouldn't want to miss the final chapter of this tale, and the first chapter of the next."

As the berries and Daniele have not yet arrived, you all bed down for the night.  The cold wind that started when the negotiation finished continues, and the sky is starkly clear.</p>
