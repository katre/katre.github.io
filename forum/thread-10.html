  <p>Tell me what your June schedule is like!  We have Duchess/katre gone on the 2nd and the 23rd, and Sara and I have plans for (I believe) the 9th (I'll check when I get home).  This would leave the 16th and 30th--anyone have a problem with either of those dates?  If there's something you have specifically going on the other weekends let me know that, too, in case we have to go with a reduced crowd for a session or two.

(And to verify:  we're still looking at Saturday evenings at 4:00 pacific/7:00 eastern.)</p>

  <p>so if I am reading this post right, 2nd is out (it already passed) 9th is out (GM and Era), the 16th is out (Vasili and Sebastien), and the 23rd is out (Vasili, Rae and Pyotr), but we are all okay on the 30th?

So that's it? We are having only one session this June, and that's on the 30th?

(Just wanted to confirm)</p>

  <p>Actually, enough people can make it on the 16th that I think we'll go ahead and do a session then anyway.  Sebastien and Vasili can guard the captains while the rest of you go do whatever it is you go do.  I shall also post on the MUD bb.</p>
