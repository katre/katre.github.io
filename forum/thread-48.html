  <p>I'm thinking of going with a "five players is a quorum" rule.  That is, if five out of the six players can make a proposed session, we'll have it then, with the sixth character being played by one of the players who's there (as we effectively did in session 2).  It seems like that would increase the number of possible session dates considerably.  How do you all feel about that?</p>

  <p>In principle, that seems reasonable (especially considering that sometimes that'll happen anyway by accident), but it might be nice if it could be softened somehow. What if five's only a quorum if it's impossible to get six for the <span style="font-style:italic">following</span> week or two as well? And maybe if we avoided skipping the same person twice in a row, if possible?</p>

  <p>As I'm at least partially responsible for this, it sounds fine to me.</p>
