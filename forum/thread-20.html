  <p>OK, I've gone over the Enchanting rules again, and this time (since I had a specific goal in mind, probably) I think I get it.  My basic take on it is:  For an increased cost in karma and by spending a whole lot of time, you can get a focus for almost no outlay of nY.  The karma and time can possibly be decreased by spending nY, but the basic rules seem to advocate a personal, 'hands-on' approach, which takes only time.

Another thing I got out of it this time is that each shamanic (and sorcerous) tradition will have its own way of doing things.  For me, that means that my Reincarnationist Tradition/Spirit of Men thing will play a big role in the sorts of materials I would gather.  In general, I'm imagining that for Thurgun, collecting raw materials is a matter of collecting discarded stuff used by people.  Raw herbal materials might involve collecting grain from a fallow field, or, heck, now-wild marijuana growing in an alley somewhere.  Raw mineral materials might include bits of a foundation stone from an old house, or a strap of leather once used as a harness.  Raw metal materials might include an old key or a discarded cane.  An Exotic Item for a focus for Emvee, for example, might be 'a key that was once used by Emvee in a past life'.

It's worth noting that these types of objects have an Object Resistance 5, instead of the OR 3 for 'natural' materials.  Perhaps this simply means that Reincarnationist Shamans have a harder time of it than other shamans, (and the bonus is that they don't have to leave the city?) or perhaps they get some sort of bonus.  The 3 vs. 5 is a difference in the TN, so it's quite substantial.  Maybe you can spend successes on a Talismongering test to find items that will count as 'natural' on the OR table instead of decreasing the time it takes to collect them?

Collecting these items looks like it takes a Talismongering test, which is another name for Enchanting Knowledge, so I have that at 3.  I get a bonus of +2 dice if I'm searching in a Spirit of Man domain, and I can summon a Nature Spirit to help, too.  It sounds a lot like scrounging, so maybe if Emvee helps, he can do a check to help more, with every 2 successes on his scrounging skill adding 1 success to the Talismongering test?  Just an idea.  Also, I dunno if Magic Pool dice can be added to this.

To form those materials into an object suitable for making a Focus, you use  some 'create item' skill.  Would Emvee's skill apply here, so he could make his own?

These raw materials would be enough to fashion a focus of some sort, but the TN might be fairly high.  As far as I can tell, to make a Force 2 Sustaining Focus, the TN for the enchanting test would be:

4 (base) + 2 (force) + 5 (Object Resistance) - 2 (virgin telesma) = 9

I could get an extra -2 for additionally using two different types of alchemical radicals, or -4 for using four different types.  This is the clearest place where something could be bought, but I have no idea how much alchemical radicals cost.  The other option is that I make them myself, which I think I could do pretty easily, but it takes 28 days/type.  Once I do make them, I think I'd have enough to last me quite a while, but the 28 days/type is set in stone.  (Can I use magic pool dice for the 'making alchemical radicals' test?)  (Another thing that would make a difference is if the materials I could collect were classified as 'natural', with an OR of 3.  This would make the base TN 7, which is much more clearly doable.)

It's worth remembering, though, that all I would really *need* is one success, and if I get to use my Magic Pool, even a TN of 9 isn't out of reach.  Two successes just means that it takes me 15 days instead of 30, and so on.

Then there's the Karma cost, which the intended recipient of the item can pay (and/or me), which starts off at 3xForce for a Sustaining focus, or 6 for Emvee's potential focus thingy, but immediately gets a -2 discount for using the Virgin Telesma. If we did end up buying/making radicals, this would help here, too, and I would also get to make a new Enchanting Test with a TN 4 (base 2 for the force; +2 for it not being me), and every 2 successes I get decrease the karma cost by another 1.  So for this bit, it's not out of the realm of possibility that the karma cost would go to zero, depending on how many radicals we could buy/create.

The only thing I haven't mentioned is creating the formula, which just takes time--it's a max of 10 days, and I'd be surprised if I couldn't get that down to 5 or less.  The only potential wrinkle would be if the formulaI created required an exotic item--for a Force 2 item, I think I'd just go back to the drawing board and try again.  It's fairly unlikely.


So, to sum up:  Required rolls and base times:

Creating a formula - 10 days
Collecting stuff - 10 days
[creating radicals - 28 days, plus more time collecting stuff]
Enchanting the item - 30 days
Check to decrease karma cost - 0 days

The first two base times can easily be decreased, I think, so I'd allocate no longer than a week for that.  Enchanting the item has the toughest TN, so while I think I could make 1 success, making the 2 needed to decrease the time to 15 days seems unreasonable to hope for.  There's also the question of which activities I can do whilst I convalesce.  Again, the first two seem like gimmes, but neither creating radicals nor enchanting the item sound like stuff you can do while your wounds heal.  But maybe wounds just heal on their own, no matter what you do?  I don't have that part of the book.

If magic pool dice can be used, they'd naturally refresh between each step, with the possible exception of the last one.

All in all, now that I understand this more, I think the rules sound reasonable.  There's a lot of stuff you have to do, but the cost in materials is $0 if you collect everything yourself, and even the increased karma costs can be bought down.  So it's mostly an expenditure of time.</p>

  <p>I like the idea that foci you create will be informed by your particular magical tradition.  I would be tempted to say that as long as you stick to the types of materials described, heavily used human artifacts, etc, you would get the shaman tradition bonus as a -2 to the TN, effectively bringing the OR 5 back to an OR 3.  However, you wouldn't get the TN bonus and the dice bonus simultaneously, so choose carefully.  I'm not sure how balanced that is, though, and I'd want to look carefully at which checks can get that bonus and which can't.  I'm also unsure how you claim that a scrap of leather is a mineral material ;-).

To let someone help you gather materials for a foci, they would also need to have Talismongering.  The standard rule, I believe, is that someone assisting you makes their roll the same as you do, and adds half of their successes to yours.

You could get someone else to help craft the actual telesma, I would think, as long as you supervise the process.

I need to re-read the section about alchemical radicals (I recall being confused about it the first time).  I am not sure if you can use the same type of radical twice for the benefit, or if you have to use two different types of radicals.  The basic example would be making a telesma that is a dagger: you could use a silver radical to make the blade, and a mineral radical to decorate the hilt, but could you instead decorate the hilt with another silver radical? I'm not sure, exactly.

I'm also not sure about the magic pool.  More research for me.

I'm not sure the karma cost can go to zero, isn't there a minimum? If not, there probably should be. ;-)

It's entirely reasonable to create the formula, collet materials, and run your store while you're recovering from your wounds.  Creating radicals is a very intensive process, however, and would be right out.  The actual item enchanting is probably a bit much, as well.

I really like the idea of doing this, it sounds pretty interesting.  We may need to get just you and Emvee together for a few sessions of scrounging stuff up. :-)</p>

  <p>lpsmith and I were discussing focus-making on #shadowrun a bit tonight. 

For the minimum first-bonding karma cost, it does seem like there should be <span style="font-style:italic">some</span> minimum. We were thinking it might be reasonable if the lowest you could reduce it using materials alone (telesma, radicals, and orichalcum) was the cost of a normal bonding, but that a good result on the enchanting test might still be able to reduce that further (to ensure that the result of the test still mattered, even with good material selection), with an absolute minimum cost of 1 karma.

For the shape of the object, I was considering a bracelet with copper wires woven through it and several electro-luminescent crystals set in it, making up some kind of simple logic circuit. Does this sound reasonable to you as something that could be crafted by hand with an Electronics B/R skill and re-forged "virgin" materials gathered according to Thurgun's shamanic tradition?

Also, when you say that someone helping to gather materials would "need to have Talismongering", does that mean they'd need to actually have to have ranks in the skill, or would it be possible to default it to something related to the task, with the usual penalty?</p>

  <p>The minimums sound reasonable, except I'm going to say that the absolute minimum is, instead of 1, the multiplier from the bonding chart.  Ie, 1 for a specific spell focus, 2 for a spirit focus, Reach + 3 for a Weapon focus.  Even with the best enchanting, it takes a bit to be able to bond a really powerful focus type.

The shape you can choose yourself (if you're the one building it).  This sounds pretty neat.

Defaulting the skill to help with collection is fine.  Looking back at the rules, it's not as easy as just adding half your successes: apparently the assistant rolls first, and then half of those successes are added as dice to the actual roll.  I'll recheck this and confirm.</p>

  <p>I mulling over an idea, and I'm not sure whether I like it or not, so I'm putting it up here.  In the basic rules, radicals and talismongering materials come in three types, metal, mineral, and herbal.  What if, for my tradition, I instead had the same three categories as the Spirits of Man--Hearth, City, and Field?

I'm not at all sure how that would connect with buying radicals from other talismongers from other traditions, especially since the basic rules seem to prize materials that have been uncorrupted by man, and the sort of stuff I'm after is exactly stuff that has been 'corrupted' by man.  Maybe I have to examine the stuff to see if I can use it before I buy it, and which of my categories it would count towards.

This also gets at the thing we mentioned about how radical cost being simply 4Xbase is unbalancing because there's no minimum.

At any rate, Emvee is interested in a Sustaining Focus, and I am too; him for Invisibility, and me for Treat.  It will sort of depend on how the numbers work out in the end, but we're thinking probably Force 3 or 4.

The first thing to do is to research a formula for this focus, and I'd like to avoid having to include an exotic material for it, so I might have to do the research more than once (an average of 3 times for a Force 4 object; 2 times for a Force 3 object).  OTOH, if you indicated you wanted us to go on an item quest, that'd be fine too ;-)

After that, it's scrounging time, where Emvee and I would collect our stuff.  This is fairly straightforward.

Next, it'd be time to see what we could purchase in the way of radicals.  This is the clearest spot to add some balance to the mix so we didn't go overboard; perhaps one radical type is relatively cheap, the second is more expensive, and the third is more expensive yet.  Maybe getting one type would involve travelling out of the city, maybe even back to that guy from the first Run.

Then it's the Enchanting Test which takes up to 30 days to see if it works and if so how long it takes, and a subsequent Enchanting Test to see if the Karma is any cheaper.  Presumably I'd at least be able to use my Magic Pool for these tests if not the previous ones, though whether it refreshes between the two rolls is up to you.</p>

  <p>I really, really like this idea.  Here are some implementation notes:

Field == Herbal (herbs grow in fields, right?)
Hearth == Mineral (a hearth is made of stone)
City == Metal (cities are made of iron!)

This is just for rules equivalence.  For flavor, they can be described however is convenient.  Given that, it takes a little longer (multiply the time by 1.5) to find radicals for purchase, but is otherwise the same.

Let's sit down and discuss the foci you both want to create, both in game terms and in terms of what they look like.  Ideally, if you two are up for it, I'd like to run a quick one-shot about getting all the materials, cause it sounds fun.  However, if you don't want to wait until the current campaign finishes, we can see what happens.

Spell Pool (which is the correct name for what I've been calling Magic Pool, bad 2nd Ed reflexes!) cannot be used for either conjuring or enchanting.  Sorry.  You could use your Karma Pool, though.</p>

  <p>Appearance of the focus: It appears to be a bracelet woven from copper wires and dyed cotton (for insulation), with a row of five electro-luminescent crystals set in the top of it. There are also eight contacts along the sides and bottom, and there's a small pocket inside where a watch battery can be inserted. 

Mundane function: If a battery is in place, touching the correct combination of contacts can store or retrieve two five-bit numbers (retrieved numbers are displayed as a sequence of lit or unlit crystals).

Magical function: Force 3 sustaining focus.</p>
