  <p>OK, I am done mourning the needless loss of both Clem's possessions and his common sense.  I thought you guys were maybe one session away from finishing last time; the bad news is that you didn't make any progress, but the good news is that that still puts you at possible one session away.

I'm busy the next couple of weekends, but are people free July 22, July 29, or August 5?</p>

  <p>I can't do the 22nd.  Anything else is good by me.</p>

  <p>Looks like I won't be free July 29th or August 19th, but would be free the intervening weekends; August 5; August 12; and, for good measure, August 26.

(It's possible I could pop in and out if it was the 29th or 19th; Sara's folks will be in town.)</p>

  <p>Looks like the process of elimination says August 5. But I would have been fine with the 22nd or 29th as well.</p>

  <p>OK, with 4 out of 6 votes in, it's looking like August 5.  Still waiting to hear from Iain and Roger though...

Please also check the Post-Six thread, since I'm waiting to hear what order you want to execute your plans in.</p>

I totally read that as "what order you want to execute your pants in."

Man, it's not the pants' fault that they're lost, huh?</p>

  <p>OK, August 5 it is.  I haven't heard from Roger (he's been off the mud since July 14th, so maybe he's on vacation or something), but even if he can't make it we still have 5 out of 6.</p>
