  <p>You've just destroyed a minor street gang and then found out your employers were raided.  What are people going to do now, before we start Run #4?</p>

  <p>Thurgun, y'do some tal'smong'ring, right? 'm thinking 'bout picking up a focus. Is that th'sort o' thing you do?

<span style="font-style:italic">After paying the next month's rent on my storage space and stocking up on canned goods, I'll be spending my time working with Thurgun on foci. For recreation, I'll be taking apart Tusker's dreamdeck, checking mBay for weird trids selling cheap, and trying to design a method for using comm lasers to produce a cable-less portable optic surveillance network. Y'know, for fun.

Unless someone convinces me otherwise IC, I'll be keeping my distance from the whole Kolmetz thing for now (although I am curious about the results of the autopsy).</span></p>

  <p>Were there any computers or anything in the building? I wanted a chance to find out more about what they were doing in this top-secret stuffer lab. I'm gonna give John a heads-up as soon as we're out the door, let him know things went bad and they might be gunning for him.

I'm also going to start poking gently into local S-K and put out the most round-about feelers to see if they're looking for info on their lab. Emphasis on the *gentle*, I don't want them following me home :P

Oh and I owe T-Bob a visit, he likes to go to the shooting range with me, get some practice in. Plus I'm hoping he'll one day have that broken Ranger Arms I can play with. Sniper rifles are sooo cool. Have you seen their autostabilizing optics and counterweights? :)</p>

  <p>Sunny:

There were a few computers and some random paperwork scattered around as you left.  Make a perception roll, TN 4, to quickly search for interesting info.

You give John a call, explain the situation.  "Aww, no, I've known Max for a long time.  This is terrible.  Unfortunately, he was my main contact in S-K.  Tell you what, you lie low a bit, I'll scout around.  You interested in leaving town for a bit? I could help."</p>

  <p>Sunny: You're not able to find many documents, since you're in a hurry to leave, but it looks like they were doing magical research, not technological.  Possibly on some type of artifact, but it's really not clear what.  Everyone involved seems to have known exactly what 'the relic' was, so no one described it.

John says: "A friend of mine down in Cali Free State needs some people for a job.  I can get you out of the city and down to a safe house in San Fran, it'll take a bit of cash but not much, and then you can listen to his pitch.  He says the job will take a week or so, so hopefully things will cool by the time you gets back.  Even if you don't take the job, you're out of the city, eh?"</p>

  <p>I'll pay my rent and spend some time hitting the nightclub scene. At some point I'll get in touch with Big Jim and see if he can get me some hookups for equipment -- I'd like another smoke grenade, a micro-transceiver and subvoc mike, and a smartlink II goggles/link for my pistol. I can't pay for the goggles yet, but I can give him 1,000 nY down and the remaining 6k nY in a couple runs (man, this times-2 street markup is sucks).

Given the state of my finances I am certainly up for a job in california -- I hear they have a lower sales tax, too.</p>

  <p>Jim says:
Okay, here's a price list:

Smoke Grenades: These are pretty cheap, I can get you a dozen for 350, or any fewer proportional.
Rating 1 Micro-Transceiver with Sub-Vocal Mic: I just got a shipment of these in recently.  Normally this would run about 2000 Y each, but today I can do you 1500 Y for the set.  If you know anyone else in the market, I can give them the same price.

Smartlink II goggles will run you 3500 Y.  That's already giving you a friendly price.  But if you buy the goggles, I'll throw in the mod to your pistol for free.

So, total (ignoring the grenades for now) you're looking at a bill for 5000 Y.  If you've only got 1000 Y now, I can't give you both.  Pick which set you want, pay me the 1000 Y, finish off the payment for that, and then if you want to discuss another payment plan for the rest, we can talk.  I'm a reasonable man.</p>

  <p>"Awesome. For those kind of prices I can give you the 5000 now, no problem. Plus I'll take a half-dozen of those grenades off your hand, since hey, you never know when you'll need a grenade. And yeah, I'll pass the word about the transceiver setup -- I can think of some other people who might be interested."</p>

John says:  I know some people in Cali Free State who are working on a bit of a, hmm, employment dispute.  It seems that they know someone who is unhappy with her current employer.  Sadly, her contract has a "feet-first" retirement plan, and so they are looking for some people to do some "contract renegotiation".

If you and your people are interested, we'll first work out how to get you there, and then I'll put you in touch with my contacts.</p>

  <p>Hey, guys, check th'forward on this. 's from th'doc that dec'mpiled Thorn. Looks like someb'dy was tryin' t' turn 'im int' either a coun'rtop or an ant. Could be what th' dreamhead was goin' on 'bout -- if mum's th'queen, maybe? Dunno.</p>

  <p>Thurgun beams at Emvee's question.  "Aww, sure!  O'i never got a chance to thank you for savin' my life back there..." Thurgun shakes his head.  "Come on down to my place, we'll talk shop."</p>

  <p>"Good call on the BLTs, Emvee. I was thinking about how Thurgun said Thorn had no aura, too -- maybe because he got turned into an ant and ants have no brains. That might explain the drive to claim more territory, too. I don't know what Kolmetz's angle is here, though -- is he just psycho? But then, I don't know if he could really be the only one involved. If this was really a fancy cloning job it seems like they'd need a full lab; I don't think Kolmetz could have had one hidden downstairs."</p>
