  <p>I'm going to try my darndest to wrap things up on Sunday, so if there's anything in particular you want to be sure gets addressed in that session, mention it here!  If we still don't get to it, we might wrap up a couple loose threads on the forums.

The main things are going to be:

-Start off fighting flying critters
-Daniele
-Drachen
-Touissant will also be along.

Anything else?</p>

  <p>I don't really expect to get to all this stuff this session, but things I wonder about:
  - The insect things and where they come from
  - Nicolette, her blood magic, and what (if anything) the connection to the insects is
  - the new Knias (Keth?)
  - the new Gaius (???)
  - the deal with Montegue and us teleporting to the past
  - Matushka's daughter
  - the other Three Beasts and where to find them
  - what happens to Montegue back in Montaigne
  - the Wolf soldiers occupying the castle, the Tyomny guys and who knew about Borin and what do the other ones think</p>

  <p>Oh, yeah--I sort of envisioned the three beasts quest as the driving force behind the sequel(s?), with, perhaps, Cat lurking around in Montaigne, maybe even Bear lumbering around the New World, and Firebird, um, somewhere else.  (Another idea I had was to hand off the GM mantle for one of those adventures, too, just for a change of pace if someone was interested.  But we can work that out after our non-7th Sea games coming up.)

I got the distinct impression that people weren't interested in following up on Nicolette, but maybe they just didn't want to fight her again (maybe Vienne instead?)  But I can bring in some stuff from the three of them fairly easily, I think.

As for the others, I'll see what I can work in, though as you mentioned, some will probably have to wait until the epilogue.</p>

  <p>I definitely want to find out what's really going on with the bugs and the Emperor and porte and ancient history and Matushka (and possibly Matushka's daughter) and that whole affair, but I figure that probably deserves to be a major focus next <i>season</i> rather than next session. I figure that if Season 3 is spent pursuing Cat in Montaigne, that'll put us in the right place to handle all of that, plus what happened to Montegue, plus LaVache.

However, I think that we should definitely have the new Knias present and properly authoritated before the session is over. And there should be some degree of resolution to the whole Wolf issue. I'd also like to get some kind of LaVache-related lead(s) or help or other use out of Touissant somehow before this season is over, although it's fine if it's in the form of, say, vague promises or written notes or things like that that the GM can fill in later when he actually thinks up what it's supposed to be.

(Oh, and as for V&N&B: I do not wish to fight them any more. However, I'd be perfectly happy to see them as non-Villain plot points. Or even forced by circumstance into uneasy allies...)</p>
