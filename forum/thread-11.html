  <p>(As per Duchess's request, this discussion is for planning what you all want to do on the 16th, after having rescued the captains.)

You all land in a small fleet of longboats with the loyal-to-Montegue captains a ways north of the city, and secret yourselves in the woods.  Those of you who feel you might be recognized change clothes again, and some head back into the town to see what's happening.

Here's the situation as you arrive:

-The mansion is almost done being packed up.  Raymonde (the guy Sebastien chatted with) is just heading down to the docks, carrying a small chest, and surrounded by porters.  Pansemne (the servant girl that can animal-speak) is standing in the doorway, watching them go.

-The docks at Kem are alive with lights and activity.  Every long-boat available is ferrying sailors and supplies out to the boats.

-Peering out to sea with your spyglass, you see the main fleet, as expected, but also two boats breaking away to the north and another two breaking away to the south.  Both are awash with lights, and bulls-eye lanterns playing over the coast.

-Also, two ships are limping back to the docks.  One has a couple holes blown into its starboard side, and the other has a gaping blackened hole in its port side.

-Having been told that his orders are waiting for him at the tavern, Charles slips in and grabs them.  They read:
<blockquote>You are charged with two tasks.  Your first and primary duty is to ensure that Montegue dies.  The easiest way would be to encourage him to pursue us in the ships we have left for him.  After the explosion, be sure to finish the job.

Your next task is to expedite the extraction of Vienne and Nicolette.  They will meet you in St. Tremult in two days at the usual location.

Your success will bring you the gratitude of L'Empereur.  Should you fail, I recommend a visit to Molhyna, as it is the one place on Theah the furthest from his reach.  Although I doubt you could escape his clutches even in the mythical New World the Vesten are going on about.  Good luck.

  <p>I'd like to get that small chest.  Any other "takers"?</p>

  <p>The chest is going to have gold? I am up for rescuing the girls. But then, I am biased</p>

  <p>I'm wondering if we can find out what LaVache values (e.g. family members, perhaps), and then arrange for a coded message to be rushed out to the fleeing ships alerting him that "we" (i.e. LaVache's agents) have uncovered that Montegue's men are one step ahead of him, and already have placed that valued thing in danger somehow -- necessitating that LaVache himself return with all speed in order to save it/them/her/whatever from a terrible fate. (As evidence that Montegue's a step ahead of him, consider how he managed to have those two ships crippled despite being miles away still!) 

The Captains who were loyal to Montegue will probably be willing to assist, and should have enough information to help us assemble our bluff. Some of them are likely to know a bit of LaVache's background, some will surely know about Montaigne military codes, and some might have be able to help us get a couple fast little ships out close enough to relay the message by semaphore.

I figure if we can pull this off, then we might even be able to inconveniently time the big stand-off and the "extraction" and perhaps other related complications to all dramatically go off at once!

(Oh, and I would be curious to see what's in Pyotr's newly-acquired chest if he does acquire it, sure.)</p>

  <p>I suppose the main question now (as opposed to the main question Saturday) is:  Is there something in particular you'd like Sebastien-bot and/or Vasili-bot to do?</p>
