  <p>Some talk on #shadowrun reminded me that we've kind of lost some of Thurgun and Emvee's focus quest stuff in all the stuff about bugs (although this reminds me to wonder about that artifact Kolmetz stole...) I seem to recall that it'll take some (in-game) time to make these focuses. Also, Thurgun and Emvee and I are going to want to learn this metamagic technique, which will take a few weeks too. 

As it is right now, it seems like the plot is likely to be pretty nonstop for a while yet (hit Aztech data, track down and hit Kolmetz). Would people like to have some kind of in-game downtime (I'm not talking about changing our play schedule, of course) so characters can do stuff? It seems like this would require both katre to be up for it and for the players to agree not to push the plot for a bit. Uh, or possibly katre has already taken this into consideration and has the timeline well in hand, but I just thought I'd bring it up, since it seems like the default timing of events is otherwise going to be immediate.</p>

  <p>I had been a bit disappointed that we ended up moving the plot too fast to explore the various threads pointing to Denver.  On the other hand, mmm, plot.

At this point, I have everything set up where I want it and am reacting to you, the players.  If the players want to lay low and power up (while Kolmetz builds up his power, mwha ha), that's cool, the plot can be made to support it.  Which isn't to say that interesting things might not happen whether you guys want them or not...</p>

  <p>If Thurgun is up for it, I think it'd be nice to try to do some work towards the foci, although I'm not sure how much IC time that would take. Also, it probably wouldn't hurt to pick up that metamagic technique before we go in for the big confrontation.</p>

  <p>Until this last bit, I expect Sunny would have been okay with a "take it slow" approach. Having had one friend go running and seen a fixer she's worked with turned and attempt to turn her, she's going to have trouble being patient.</p>

  <p>Hmm, yeah, and possibly by the same token leaving town again immediately isn't going to seem like the best idea either. Well, ok, so how about if we try and find out where the Aztech data is, and find out where Kolmetz is, and if we can find them, great, we'll take them on, and if not perhaps there'll be some chance for a delay there as we look around. (Also, it occurs to me that Sunny has a reason to want to go to Denver too, if she wants to hit that betaware clinic.) I guess, hell, we might not even need to take Kolmetz on ourselves -- it might be that we just point SK at him and stand back. (Also also, things can obviously shake out a bunch of different ways and I don't know what katre has in mind, but it may be that Kolmetz is a relatively small step on the path to some bigger hit on the Aztechs -- but a strike against a major corporation is a big enough deal that that might be a next-campaign thing, I dunno.)</p>
