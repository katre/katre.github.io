  <p><span style="font-style:italic">The other thread is getting kind of long, so here's one for hashing out a few more specific details of the plan. This is based on previous channel discussion plus some more extrapolation by me.</span>

"Ok, so it sounds like the the plan is for the six of us to sneak in to the hive and penetrate as far as we can to the center before setting off the bomb. We'll probably get noticed at some point and have to force our way further, but we'll start off stealthy. If Istereth is up for running a diversionary attack with some drones on one side of the hive while we come in the other, that'd probably help us out, although it does mean the hive will be on full alert when we're sneaking in.

From what Ehran says, I gather we're talking immaterial spirits, guys like Thorn, and normal humans, some of whom might be shamans. Thurgun and Emvee are going to have to keep off their spells and fight off any immaterial spirits, although Ehran said that insecticide is effective against the spirit, so maybe Sunny can work out some special grenades or something. I guess I should take point when we're sneaking and then drop back to let Sunny and Tony lead once the shooting starts.

Equipment-wise, for personal stuff, I don't know how to use any heavy stuff so I'm not going to mess with it myself, although it seems like anyone who can should be packing heavier firepower. If Ehran can get me some better armor that seems like the way to go too -- camo armor by choice, or maybe light security armor, although we're going to have to be able to move fast. <span style="font-style:italic">And I guess the deal is that every two points of armor beyond your quickness lowers your combat pool by one, which is kind of a dicey tradeoff.</span> I don't know if they're likely to be packing guns or not -- Thorn didn't but maybe the more-human ones will. I've got low-light already, but anyone who doesn't might want to see if Ehran can hook them up with a pair of low-light/thermo goggles. I don't know what the deal is going to be in the hive, but we'd better be prepared for darkness. Oh, and we'll all need gas masks, of course -- as long as Sunny sticks to inhaled poisons only we should be fine if the masks stay on.

Seems like Sunny should carry the bomb since explosives are her specialty. I guess we'll just have to wing it once we're inside -- I don't know how to figure out when we're near the center, but maybe Emvee can work out a way to find out where the geographical center is of the sewer area, and the organizational center ought to be nearby. Once we drop the bomb I guess we run like hell and then come back for any mop-up.

If Ehran has the me-- elves, I'd think he'd want to put some guards as a far-out perimeter to catch any bugs that get away, but it's up to him.

That all sound right?"</p>

  <p>"That's about what I was thinking too. It's really cool how you can get just about anything in grenades, so I don't think insecticide grenades'll be a stretch.

I'm all good with the sneaking around. Since we're underground, I figure we should hold off on the really heavy stuff. I was just going to take my Alpha and a bunch of minigrenades, plus some regular grenades. I'd like to see if they've got some mines available. Those make neat distractions!

Upgrading armor's a good idea. I'm going to check and see if they've got the hardened mil-grade stuff. It's a little bulky, but I've tried the lightest version before and I think I'll be okay with it. Like the security armor, you can get it with thermo and low-light in the helmet and good environmental protections. I'm not planning on slinging anything worse than the insecticide, but I don't think we want to be breathing that stuff."</p>
