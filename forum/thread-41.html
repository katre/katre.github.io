  <p>Later tonight I'll post how much damage people took and need to heal, although I bet it could probably all be healed in one day by natural healing plus Clem using lots of C?W spells.  Finn's also going to need to camp out for 24 hours anyway if he wants a new animal companion, and Clem will need to use 5000gp worth of those diamonds if he's going to raise Crumbly.

Finn had snagged the collar from the gargoyle on the way out - it's made of leather and studded with ten huge bluish gems (like an inch wide).  He had nothing else on him.</p>

  <p>Let's move these bodies outside. Then we can check for DNR tags, and hopefully ye can raise one or two of them, Clem.

  <p>Rosie cures herself her 18 HP from <span style="font-style:italic">Wholeness of Body</span>, which I believe brings her to 29 out of 68, leaving 39 points left.

Assuming we find the DNR tag on Ehran, do we get his stuff?  Or did the DNR tag say, "Strap my posessions to Wolf and send him into the woods"?</p>

Man, and here I figured baddass immortal elves from the Fourth Age wouldn't have problems with a gargoyle.

Regarding Elgran, the dead elven ranger, Wolf has run off.  I'll let dfan decide whether his gear counts as spoils for the rest of the group.</p>

  <p>Here are everyone's hit points after Rosie uses Wholeness of Body, Crumbly is raised, and everyone gets one night of sleep:
[list]Clem 19/68
Crumbly 16/42 (after Raise Dead)
Finn 75/75
Grog 24/70
Paulie 48/48
Rosie 38/68
[/list:u:d46cc65eb7]

Plus Clem has a bunch of healing spells, obviously.

Calling the first day of the adventure was Day 1, I'm going to assert that the rest of Day 1 and Day 2 was spent resting and healing (while Finn spends 24 hours praying for a new animal companion), and that you're ready to go back in on Day 3.  Maybe Paulie sent Featherbeard off with a note to Sargent's character or something, or he has some other way of hearing that you're out here and could use some help.  Feel free to role-play Crumbly's raising or what have you.

Also, you guys can have Elgran's stuff.  At the least you can sell it to finance future resurrections :)</p>

  <p>OK, as far as I can make out, Elgran (not Ehran, whoops) has the following magic items:

* Cloak of Elvenkind (+5 on Hide checks)
* Boots of Elvenkind (+5 on Move Silently checks)
* Gloves of Dexterity +2
* Ring of Protection +2
* +1/+1 Quarterstaff
* +1 Composite Shortbow (requres +3 str bonus, which it adds to damage)
* +2 Mithral chain shirt
* Potions of:  Cure Light (9), Cure Moderate (4), Magic Fang (5), Greater Magic Fang (1), Pass Without Trace (2), Spider Climb (2), Elixir of Sneaking (2), Dust of Tracelessness (2)


Of the items on the list, the +2 Ring is the only one thing Rosie could personally use, since she currently only has a +1 ring.  I already have a cloak, boots, and gloves, don't use those weapons, and can't use armor.

People without cloaks:  Clem, Finn

People without boots:  Paulie, Crumbly, Clem, Finn, Grog

People without gloves: Finn (Paulie's Ioun stone already gives him a dex bonus)

People with a ring slot available:  Rosie (could exchange +2 for +1), Crumbly, Clem, Grog (+2 for +1 exchange)

People with +3 str (who could maybe use the bow):  Grog, Clem, Finn

I dunno who could use the other weapons/armor.  Someone should hold onto the masterwork dagger, at least.

It seems pretty obvious that Crumbly would be best suited to getting the boots, the cloak would be a toss-up (unless Crumbly wanted to exchange his +3 Cloak of Resistance for it?), and Finn's the only one who can use the gloves.  

I dunno about the ring.  Does it make more sense to spread out AC bonuses among the party, or to make one person with an incredible AC who can stand in front?  Because if the former, we could split up the +2 bonus among, say, myself and Crumbly, and if the latter, I say we give it to Clem.

As far as the potions go, we determined the Magic Fang would work for me (woo!); if Junior Kong also wants a couple, we could send a couple his way, too.

The sneaky stuff we could let Crumbly hold, and I dunno about Spider Climb.

There's also Sarge's character, whoever that turns out to be, but he should probably pick last.

In general, that's a lot of stuff going to Crumbly, but that's OK, because hey, the poor guy's only level 8 ;-)</p>

  <p>Crumbly prefers his own cloak to that elfish crap.

Also, he doesn't want the dagger, because he doesn't intend to engage in melee ever again.  Some extra AC wouldn't come amiss, but it's probably better spent on a fighter.</p>

  <p>Clem can comfortably heal everyone with a day's worth of spells. In fact he probably has enough left that same evening, but sure, let's take an extra day. I can also Teleport some people into town and back if we want to get any business done, like appraising the gargoyle's collar.

I'm taking charge of the 1000gp in diamonds from Elgran's corpse. I need 4000gp more to resurrect Crumbly. Okay, I'm passing my spell component pouch around, and it'd better be stuffed full of diamonds when it gets back to me!

If dfan agrees we could probably get another 5000gp by selling Elgran's quarterstaff (since nobody else is a two-weapon fighter, right?) and armour (or if anybody wants it, we can sell their old armour). Let's put this towards a resurrection fund for ONE person in the next session.

Hmm, hey, those magic items. I'll certainly take the masterwork daggers if nobody else does, and I would love to get a +1 ring of protection if Grog or Rosie takes the +2.

Everyone else please take one or two healing potions, because in that last fight it would have been tactically useful for everyone to have had some healing ability. I mean, I'll do what I can, but I only have a limited number of Mass Cure spells and otherwise it's a touch range thing.

During our day of rest I'm going to try casting a few Divination spells (using up my remaining spare change) to see if G'taar can give us any pointers. Feel free to suggest some questions for Him.</p>

  <p>Rosie already has a bunch of CLWs in her backpack, but she'll take Elgran's pouch for slightly-faster access, and stick a couple CLWs in it.

<span style="font-style:italic">(to Clem) "Hmm, how about 'Should we follow the advice on the runes?'  I'd kind of like to know if this guy's messing with us, or if he's actually giving us semi-useful information.  I guess other questions might be "Where's a good source of hidden treasure we might miss?" or "What other monsters are in this dungeon that are as tough or tougher than that gargoyle?"</span>

Following the 'we should mess with stuff' idea, Rosie works at excavating the last entrance whilst we wait.  And heals herself another 18HP the next day, if necessary.</p>

  <p>Before we send Clem into town, I'd like to run a Detect Magic over both the collar and the rooms we just cleared the gargoyle out of (and since I guess I get a day and a half's worth of spells, may as well do the parts of the corridor we've passed so far too). If the collar's magical and has more than a weak aura, we might as well burn a scroll of Identify on it. If it's not, what's the best Appraise modifier in the party? (Mine's +4.) It seems we might want Crumbly to check those rooms for secret compartments, too, in case one holds treasure we want to take to town as well.

As for equipment, it doesn't look like there's much that's useful to Paulie, at least on Rosie's list. I could take the boots, but since Paulie's Move Silently isn't that bad anyway (+12), it might be better to give them to someone who needs them more. If we end up selling some of this equipment for cash (as opposed to just for diamonds), then I wouldn't mind taking 2065 gp of the proceeds to buy a +1 mithr*l buckler.

Elgran's gear, minus the diamonds we already used, should be worth 35,000 gp. We'd need to sell 10,000 gp worth to get another 5,000 gp of diamonds (assuming we're going with the rule that selling gear gets you one-half the original cost), leaving 25,000 gp of equipment. One-sixth of that (assuming the five PC's and Grog, although I'd understand if people didn't want to count Grog) would be about 4,170, which should be just enough to sell for said buckler, if it happens to work out that way. If it doesn't work out that way, I can either just take some smaller stuff (like potions), or just wait until next time. The collar might affect things as well, of course. If it is magical, I wonder which slot it takes up...

It sounds like Rosie's interested in the ring (if we split the bonus), so Grog won't try for it. That leaves the boots and the bow. Grog would be fine taking either, but doesn't have a strong yearning for either, so if someone else wants one (or if we want to put them towards the diamond fund), that's fine. I guess the bow would be more useful for him than the boots, since his only ranged weapon is pretty weak, and he really shouldn't be trying to sneak anywhere anyway.

Anyway, I also agree with Clem/Iain about selling the quarterstaff. And I agree with Rosie about letting Crumbly have more than his share. But what else do we want to sell, to raise enough for the diamonds? And do we need to raise enough for 5,000 gp of diamonds, or just 4,000 gp + Sargent?</p>

  <p>Oh, and we should try to buy a shovel. If for no other reason, then just so we can bury Elgran.</p>

  <p>I'm going to let you sell items at half value (as suggested in the rules) to raise money for more Raise Deads, but not to buy new random magical items.  Although you "paid" for it all, the equipment you have is stuff that you've accumulated over your whole career - it's not like you went into the Magic Mart with 36,000 gp.  The nearest town is not big enough to have one of every item in the DMG.</p>

  <p>There's a faint aura of magic from within the collar, and while investigating it Crumbly finds that there's a secret compartment in it holding a slip of parchment with magical runes, which apparently had the aura you detected.

Clem is able to read them with Read Magic:

  <p>Since the collar itself isn't magical, we may as well sell it. I don't trust my own appraise check, but I'll try one anyway:

<span style="font-style:italic">You roll 1d20+4: 11+4 | 15</span>

I assume we'll be using Clem's teleport to get to town. If he wants (and can take) company, Paulie can go with him (his charisma might help with haggling). I'm guessing that there are places where jewelry can be professionally appraised for a small fee, and also places where it can be sold. No one has objected yet, so let's say we do both of those (preferably at two different places, to reduce the chance of getting fleeced). We can sell the quarterstaff too, and once we know how much we can get for those, we'll know if we need to sell anything else to make 4,000 gp.</p>

  <p>The collar itself isn't worth anything, but it has ten big bluish gems mounted on it.  They're probably worth around 100 gp apiece, though it would be unlikely that you could sell them for full value.</p>

  <p>That's 1000gp of gems, then. No one has made any noises about wanting Elgran's quarterstaff or mithr*l shirt, so let's assume those are up for sale. Assuming the usual 50% trade-in value, that gives us (1000gp + 5260gp + 5100gp)/2 = 5680gp. If Sargent brings his own 1000gp of diamonds to the table, that gives us an extra 1680gp to spare. Looks like we can either A) save it/give it to someone as cash, B) sell another 6640gp of stuff as well to get enough for <span style="font-style:italic">two</span> raises, or C) keep the collar and its gems. Any opinions?</p>

  <p>Here's one possible distribution of wealth:
[list]
[*]<span style="font-weight:bold">Sold</span>: (total: 11386.98gp -&gt; 5705.91gp)
  +1/+1 Quarterstaff (5260gp -&gt; 2630gp)
  +2 Mithral chain shirt (5100gp -&gt; 2550gp)
  Jewelled collar (1000gp -&gt; 500gp)
  Backpack (2gp -&gt; 1gp)
  Bedroll (0.1gp -&gt; 0.05gp)
  Candles x4 (0.04gp -&gt; 0.02gp)
  Coins: copper x4, silver x8, gold x4, platinum x2 (24.84gp -&gt; 24.84gp)

  Elixir of Sneaking x2 (500gp)
  Potion: Cure Moderate Wounds (300gp)
  Potion: Cure Light Wounds x2 (100gp)
  Potion: Pass Without Trace x2 (100gp)
  Potion: Spider Climb x2 (600gp)
  Signal whistle (0.8gp)
[*]<span style="font-weight:bold">Finn</span>: (total: 4500gp)
  Gloves of Dexterity +2 (4000gp)
  Potion: Cure Moderate Wounds (300gp)
  Potion: Cure Light Wounds x1 (50gp)
  Potion: Magic Fang x3 (150gp)
[*]<span style="font-weight:bold">Clem</span>: (total: 5474gp)
  +1 Ring of Protection (2000gp, Rosie's)
  Cloak of Elvenkind (2500gp)
  Potion: Cure Moderate Wounds (300gp)
  Potion: Cure Light Wounds x1 (50gp)
  Masterwork dagger (302gp)
  Masterwork silvered dagger (322gp)
[*]<span style="font-weight:bold">Rosie</span>: (total: 6951gp)
  +2 Ring of Protection (8000gp - 2000gp)
  Potion: Cure Light Wounds x2 (100gp)
  Potion: Greater Magic Fang +1 (750gp)
  Potion: Magic Fang x2 (100gp)
  Pouch, belt (1gp)
[*]<span style="font-weight:bold">Paulie</span>: (total: 120gp)
  Potion: Cure Light Wounds x2 (100gp)
  Rope, Silk 50' x2 (20gp)
[*]<span style="font-weight:bold">Grog</span>: (total: 2967.22gp)
  +1 Composite Shortbow (2600gp)
  Potion: Cure Moderate Wounds (300gp)
  Potion: Cure Light Wounds x1 (50gp)  
  Arrow x40 (2gp)
  Rations x5 (2.5gp)
  Canvas, 1 sq yard x2 (0.2gp)
  Waterskin, full (1gp)
  Whetstone (0.02gp)
  Flint and steel (1gp)
  Mirror, steel (10gp)  
  Sewing needle (0.5gp)
[*]<span style="font-weight:bold">Elgran</span>: (total: 10gp)
  Outfit, explorer's (10gp)
[/list:u:fdeb75af97]

Then we can buy 4000gp of diamonds and a shovel for 2gp, leaving us 1703.91gp in cash. Is there anything in particular we'd want to buy with any of that? Are there any magic items that we <span style="font-style:italic">can</span> buy in this town, if we wanted? If not, we may as well actually keep the collar for now and just have 1203.91gp in cash.

Feel free to suggest modifications to this, especially if I assigned you anything you don't particularly want but think someone else might like. I gave Rosie's ring of protection to Clem because he'll probably be in combat more than Crumbly. On the other hand, Crumbly seems kinda short-changed given that he's now a level below everyone, so maybe that's not such a good idea? Also, I tossed most of the miscellaneous junk we might want to keep (rations, canvas, etc.) in Grog's inventory, just since his haversack's got plenty of free space in it; if anyone else wants to grab some of that instead, go right ahead.</p>
