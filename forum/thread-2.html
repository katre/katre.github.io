  <p>So, it turns out everyone can make it on the 31st!  Yay!  This is particularly cool because there should be lots of stuff going on during this session, some of which I've been building up to for a while.  I'm going to be trying a few different things mechanicswise during the session, too, and figured I'd go ahead and tell you about them beforehand so you're ready: 
                                                                                
-The party will be in three different groups, and we'll be switching between them.  Everything will be 'open', meaning that you as players will know everything that's going on (because otherwise it gets rather boring), but do remember that your *characters* won't necessarily be privy to everything.
                                                                                
The groups will be:
  Alix and Sebastien at the treaty negotiations with Montegue and the Gaius;
  Era and Raelynn inducting Ketheryna into the Sophia's Daughters; and  
  Charles, Pyotr, and Vasili on their own in Pavtlow.
                                                                                
As such, when its your group's turn, don't be afraid to grab the spotlight a little more than you usually get to when there's six or seven of you.

inky and Sargent:  Let me know how you picture yourself helping with the negotiations.  I'm sort of thinking of a variety of people sitting around a table, with the main conversation between the Gaius (Ilya) and Montegue, but with others chiming in with suggestions/insights/objections/etc.  If that works for you, we'll go with that.
                                                                                
Sara and Duchess:  if you two can help me a bit with the worldbuilding here, that'd be great:  if one or both of you have a basic idea of how the induction ceremony should go, it might be fun to roleplay that out a bit.  You two will be familiar with it, as you both entered Sophia's Daughters via such a ceremony yourselves back in the day, and probably have attended and possibly assisted other ceremonies for other people since then.  This one will be a bit smaller than is typical, but not overly unusual--it'll be the Handmaiden, you two, and Ketheryn.  (I mentioned this to Sara and she immediately got a couple ideas for the ceremony--if the two of you email each other (and cc me) that might work, since Sara won't be on-MUD to brainstorm.)
                                                                                
If any of the rest of you have something in particular you'd like to be doing in the city, let me know, and I can have you doing that before everything goes to hell.  Whoops, did I say that out loud? ;-)
                                                                                
                                                                                
--As this session is supposed to be the culmination of past events, I am having a ONE DAY SPECIAL on DRAMA DICE!  If you use an item you've obtained in season 1 or 2, or perform an action based on significant knowledge gained likewise, you will receive your choice of TWO DRAMA DICE or ONE STORY DIE!  There's a couple things I have in mind here (Sivka; the sleeping draught), but feel free to use other things as well.
                                                                                
You can also gain a drama die for acting according to your hubris and taking a mechanical penalty of some sort for it (I've been getting better at making up random mechanics at the drop of a hat, or you can propose something).
                                                                                
Also, drama dice are going to refresh at the end of this Event (which I'm planning on only taking one session, but you know how these things go), so feel free to spend 'em while you got 'em.
                                                                                
Any other questions, feel free to e-mail or catch me on the MUD.  Or, if you happen to be my wife, you can ask me in person.  Thanks, everyone! I'm really having a lot of fun with this.
