  <p>So, how's May look for you people?  We're busy the 26th, and I know DCC's on the 12th, (though we could theoretically do it after that).  That would leave a natural spot for the 5th and 19th, though of course the 5th is only a few days away.

Let me know what Saturdays work for you (and, heck, Sundays at 1:00 pacific/4 eastern while we're at it, though I know we loose a Cater then).</p>

  <p>All of the above are go.  I do other stuff on the weekends, just at different times.  Honestly.</p>

  <p>We are good the 19th. We are also good the other weekends except the 5th and the 26th. I will be up for a potentially late Sunday night on 27th, too, since it's Memorial Day on Monday.</p>

  <p>OK, looks like everyone is OK with the 19th, so we'll go with that.  Let's also try for the 27th; specific time to be determined on the 19th when everyone's around.

With any luck, Stephen will even be there ;-)
