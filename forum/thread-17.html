  <p>Hi gang,

So it seems we've hit a bit of a lull in RPG action, and I'm going a bit mental waiting for D&D 4th Edition to arrive.

I've thought for a while that a fantasy take on Spirit of the Century would work well, drawing inspiration from Conan, Lankhmar, The Scorpion King, etc etc.

Right now I'm just gauging the interest in such a thing -- if it seems like something you might be interested in playing, please post.


Cheers,
Roger</p>

  <p>I'll just get this out of the way right now:

  <p>I only just realized that some people might not yet be spending their days immersed in the sweet nectar of the Spirit of the Century ruleset, so here's some links and stuff:

<a href="http://zork.net/~nick/loyhargil/fate3/fate3.html">http://zork.net/~nick/loyhargil/fate3/fate3.html</a> -- the rules in SRD format

<a href="http://www.drizzle.com/~dans/rpg/oneshots/peril/sotc.html ">http://www.drizzle.com/~dans/rpg/oneshots/peril/sotc.html</a>  -- inky's quick and easy SotC rules summary

<a href="http://evilhat.wikidot.com/spirit-of-the-century">http://evilhat.wikidot.com/spirit-of-the-century</a> -- the official wiki.  I wrote most of the advice in <a href="http://evilhat.wikidot.com/discussions-and-advice">http://evilhat.wikidot.com/discussions-and-advice</a> so those are things that I personally think are good ideas, anyway.

Houserules:  I'll probably be using that 2/4/6 Consequence rule -- I'll dig out the actual text of how that works and get it in here at some point.</p>

  <p>As long as there are snake priests, I'm interested.  And, quite frankly, even if there aren't.</p>

  <p>More clarification:

I'm picturing this as one (or possibly more) sessions of one-shot, standalone, sorts of scenarios.  So pretty episodic even if there is more than one adventure that comes of it.

Familiarity with the rules is not required; they tend to be fairly lightweight anyway.</p>

  <p>Also if you feel like reading or re-reading some classic Conan, many of the stories are available under Howard at

<a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/plusfifty-a-m.html#letterH">http://gutenberg.net.au/plusfifty-a-m.html#letterH</a>

Particularly apt stories include The Tower of the Elephant, People of the Black Circle, and Queen of the Black Coast.</p>

  <p>I'll be running a 'session' of character generation on Saturday, March 8th, starting at 1400 mudtime (EST) on the MUD, probably in #spirit.

If you can make it, great!  We'll get the ball rolling.  If not, don't worry too much about it.


Cheers,
Roger</p>

  <p>The character generation session went great!  Big props to everyone who could make it.

I'd like everyone to start a thread here, with "Spirit of the Century" as the Category, and a subject that contains your mudname and your character's name -- something like 'Sming the Indubitable -- played by Roger'.

Please post your character background, Aspects, novel summarization, novels you co-starred in, and also Skills and Stunts if you're along to those already.

An example character sheet can be found in the SRD over at <a href="http://zork.net/~nick/loyhargil/fate3/fate3.html#character-worksheet">http://zork.net/~nick/loyhargil/fate3/fate3.html#character-worksheet</a> but don't worry too much about the format or whatnot.


Cheers,
Roger</p>

  <p>I whipped up a little relationship-map showing who is co-starring where:

  <p>I've put together a cleaned-up version of this at:

<A HREF="http://spod-central.org/~lpsmith/rpg/transcripts/conan/SpiritOfConan_rmap.jpg">http://spod-central.org/~lpsmith/rpg/transcripts/conan/SpiritOfConan_rmap.jpg</a>

Only one crossed line!

If anyone cares about continuity, here's the current timeline, based on people's introduction stories, and some of my own character write-up.

These four go in this order at present, though the second and third could be switched with a slight tweak to my write-up:

<b>The Slaughter in the Fane</b>:  Introduces Sylith and Iason; possible introduction of Everard
<b>Lojban the Destroyer vs. the Demon-Beast of Yucca Flats</b>:  Sylith and Everard's story continue; introduction of Lojban
<b>Iason vs. the Volcano God</b>: Iason and Lojban's stories continue; possible introduction of Joden
<b>Cain and the Ashen Curse</b>:  Sylith and Iason's stories continue; Cain introduced

The next two stories come after the first four, in either order:

<b>Tack and the Tomb of the Priests</b>:  Cain and Lojban's stories continue; possible introduction of Tack
<b>Joden goes to Hell</b>:  Cain and Joden's stories continue; possible introduction of Tack

And the last story can take pace any time in the continuity it wants:

<b>Lord Everard in... THE VAMPIRE ROSE</b>:  Everard, Tack, and Joden; all three possible introductions.</p>

  <p>There'll be more character generation going on again this Saturday, March 15, and starting at about the same time -- 1400 mudtime/EST.

I might be a bit late -- I've got some legal /wedding stuff to attend to earlier in the day.  But feel free to start without me.

  <p>I've posted some further information about the adventure:

http://roger.carbol.com/rpg/SoH/teaser.pdf

Hopefully that'll help some people with deciding where to go with their character.

And everyone should figure out a good reason why they're going to see the King.
