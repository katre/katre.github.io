  <p>Those of you captured by the elves wake up after some unspecified amount of time in a clean, bare, jail cell.  There are six cots set up, one of you on each (Asher, Thurgun, Tony, Emvee, Sunny, and Slippery Fish).  Your weapons and other offensive armaments are gone (except for the ones in your bodies), but most of your other gear is still on you.  Everyone is fully healed.

After you sit there for a while, Ehran shows up on the other side of the barred door, with a flunky of some sort standing behind him.

"Ah, good morning, I'm glad you all recovered.  You may or may not be pleased to know that the item which was in your possession is safely where it belongs, and under heavy security."

"Now, I am not one to let grudges to linger, so if you are willing to answer a few questions, I have a proposition which I hope will be mutually beneficial.  I do hope you cooperate."

"Based on the security camera footage, none of you were actually involved with taking the item.  I presume it was passed to you by a second or even third party.  So if you can tell me where you obtained the item, and what you were instructed to do with it, we can get on with business."</p>

  <p>Istereth:  You're hiding out in Tir Tairngire.  A few days after you split up, the borders opened again, but now no-one is answering when you call their cell phones.</p>

  <p>Thurgun looks around the room and everyone seems to be looking at him.  He sighs.

"We met some guy who called himself 'Benny' at some diner downtown.  It was supposed to be a simple courier run--claimed he was too busy to take it to Seattle himself.  And since we were going there anyway... Well.  Someone at, hmm, Young Elven Technologies?  was supposed to pick it up.  Dunno who."  Thurgun shrugs.  "That's pretty much it."

"Have you ever wanted access to deeper levels of knowledge?"

Erhan points to Thurgun.  "Have you ever wanted to cast stronger spells without the physical penalties?"

Erhan turns to Asher.  "And have you found that you've hit a wall in your training, and can go no further, become no more powerful?"

"I can teach you to pass these limits, and show you were much other knowledge lies.  I will teach you how to become true initiates of magic."

"But first, we must come to an agreement."</p>

  <p>Thurgun apologizes more to Fish, who packs up his stuff and leaves.  Thurgun decides to take the job, and to ask if he can learn how to make an Anchoring Focus for summoning spirits (this isn't in the rules; feel free to have them say, "We don't know anything about that.")  He wants to learn how to do this so he can give one to Fish to help him in the fields (a Force-1 field spirit once a day, say).</p>

  <p>After a short while (you are encouraged by the servants to "freshen up"), you are escorted to a sumptuous dining room where Ehran is seated at a large table.  Over a long lunch (real food, never seen a vat!) he explains his job.

"We've recently discovered a large nest of Invae in Portland.  They seem to have started in the basement of an abandoned building but have spread and are now mainly in the sewers.  They've been running around, abducting people off the street, stealing building supplies, that sort of thing.  We need a team to penetrate their nest with a specially-constructed bomb, set the timer, and then escape.  The bomb should be deadly to the Invae but not to you."

"We'll be happy to equip you with anything you need, you may discuss your requirements for gear with the army liason here.  I'm sure you have questions, but please, try the pear gelato first."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, out in the Tir forests, the big ol' truck emerges from another hiding spot, where Istereth has been waiting about a day after losing contact before trying to quietly get the hell out of the country.

"Greetings, Sophell.  I hope you have not been worrying about me too much....  Yes, the border closing did cause us some problems....  No, you couldn't have helped even if no one did find out.  I'm heading out for Seattle again now.  I'll tell you more when I get there.  You too; until then."

"Yes, a much larger nest than we believe we have was the immediate cause of the containment of Chicago.  We wish to take care of this one before things become that badly off.  We believe this nest is relatively recent, and that hopefully therefore it will be easier to penetrate and dispose of."

"The Invae are ancient, and evil.  No-one who is not part of their cult can visit the metaplane they come from, but reports are that it is 'crowded'.  Once a living person becomes an acolyte of the Invae, he will begin summoning the spirits into living human hosts.  Some times the host gives in completely, leaving a true spirit behind.  Some times the host fights, leaving a warped and twisted body with the Invae as the soul.  And some times the host fights so successfully that the outward form is entirely unchanged, but in every case the host's soul is gone, and the Invae control."</p>

  <p>Sounds like we're prob'ly gonna do this. B'fore we do, I wanna do a little prep work, an' I wonder 'f y'might be able t' put me in touch wi' s'me people who c'n help.

<span style="font-style:italic">I'm interested in a teacher who can teach Increase Reflexes 3 at Force 1. According to the book, a teacher costs 1000nY x the Force, plus living expenses (although if Ehran's letting us stay here for a couple days while we work stuff out, he might let the teacher stay too). Learning the spell involves a Sorcery test against TN2 (2xForce), and can be complemented by a Magic Background test and aided by the teachers Instruction test (TN4, +1 die for each two successes). Given any successes at all, the time to learn a Force 1 spell is 1 day. I'm also looking for a Force 1 sustaining focus, which is listed at 15000nY. </span></p>

"Here are the sewer plans I mentioned.  The center of the nest seems to be underneath the bock between 13th and 14th, and between Elm and Birch.  We've evacuated all the families in the area, of course, but they would appreciate it if their homes were left standing."

  <p>Later, Istereth talks shop with the army's supplies representative (in Sperethiel):

"Yes, I'm looking for a medium-sized drone, able to get through elf-sized passages and carry considerable firepower and armoring.  Something with legs would seem a good idea, as we may need to climb over rubble.  Naturally, its top speed wouldn't be as high as that of a wheeled or flying model, but quick motions are always helpful...."
