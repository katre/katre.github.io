  <p>I don't want to use up my whole Saturday two weeks in a row (unless there aren't any other possibilities in April), so I vote against April1, but as of now I could do any other Saturday in April (8, 15, 22, 29).</p>

  <p>I will probably be on holiday on either the 8th or 15th (we haven't decided which yet, I'll let you know when we do). 22nd and 29th both look to be free.

My preference is the 22nd.</p>

  <p>At this point, I think all four Saturdays are free for me. I guess I'd prefer whichever of the 8th or 15th Iain will be around for, since that would open the possibility of playing again on the 22nd or 29th. If two sessions in the same month isn't too daunting a notion, that is.</p>

  <p>Apr 15 is right in the middle of Easter, so I'm going to vote against it out of principle.

The other Saturdays should be just fine.

  <p>I will be out of town the 22nd (sorry, Clem), but I believe the other April weekends would be OK with me.  If we went for the 1st anyway, I'd have to be out by 1-ish my time (4:00 eastern).

  <p>Sounds like I need to figure out when I'm holiday, then. I'll get right on that.</p>

  <p>I am not available Easter weekend. Otherwise I should be free.</p>

  <p>OK, here's the summary:

 Apr 1: Lucian would have to leave after 4 hours
 Apr 8: Iain possibly on holiday
 Apr 15: No
 Apr 22: No Lucian
 Apr 29: Looks free

The 8th looks ideal if it turns out that Iain is available.  So my tentative plan is the 29th in either case, and hopefully the 8th too.

As I said in my mud post, figuring out how to make further progress into the tomb from your current state would probably be less tedious here than on the mud, so I suggest doing that if you're up for it.  Searchy McSpot (I mean Crumbly) is probably the guy who'd have to drive it.</p>

  <p>The 8th it is.  Id' love to do the 29th as well (if you have not already succeeded or failed), but I may have a concert that day.</p>
