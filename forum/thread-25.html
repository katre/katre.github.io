  <p>After arriving in San Fran, Sunny calls up the number she's been saving and arranges the meet.  You all head to a rather nice restaurant downtown.  After dinner arrives, Johnson (a short black woman, this time) begins the spiel:

My employer has a small problem, and we're looking for people who can help.  We've recently been in contact with a Dr. Helen Rohm.  Dr. Rohm is one of North America's most prominent biothaumaturgic researchers, and for the past several years has been working for Ares Macrotechnology on the problem of cyberimplants for the magically Awakened.

Recently, Dr. Rohm has become, hmm, dissatified with her employment with Ares, and would like to pursue a similar position with my employer.  Unfortunately, her current contract does not have any type of retirement clause, although it does have excellent death benefits.  Therefore, we need to find someone willing to go and extract her from her current situation.

We'd also like to, at the same time, have a few people make a raid on Ares' headquarters here in town.  There are some hard-copy results of Dr. Rohm's research that we'd like to aquire, and it seems best to manage both at once.

We have a detailed schematic of Outpost Zeta-Q, where Dr. Rohm is now, and of the facility in town that has the actual data.  We also have secure communications with Dr. Rohm, once daily.  Unfortunately, we cannot allow you to use the communications channel directly, but if you have any questions for Dr. Rohm, I can pass them on.

Are you interested in the job?

<span style="font-style:italic">The extraction at Outpost Zeta-Q will be run Thursday night, July 21st, at 9 mudtime.  The data raid will be Sunday, July 24th, at noon mudtime.  Decide in-character who is doing what, and feel free to ask Johnson for more details.  I'll be posting more during the week as people ask.</span></p>

  <p>"O'i don't know much about data, but O'i can protect someone.  Count me in." Thurgun scratches his head.  "Death benefits, hunh?  Does that mean we get extra if Ares thinks she's dead?  Uh, how much you payin', anyway?"

<span style="font-style:italic">In other runs, after we accept, we get more info; I assume the same's true here?  Also, Thurgun knows enough to know he's not the best negotiator in the group; he'll bow out of actual $$ discussions.</span></p>

Johnson replies:

I see you've misunderstood me.  By mentioning "death benefits" instead of a "retirement clause", I was trying to delicately state that, if Dr. Rohm attempts to quit, the staff at Ares have instructions to shoot to kill.

As far as the money, we are willing to pay 50,000 Y for Dr. Rohm's safe extraction, and an additional 20,000 Y for the data.</p>

  <p>"I take it we don't need to destroy copies of her existing research, just ensure that you get the information contained in the physical copies. Is this all notebooks and papers, or is there anything larger like lab equipment? Roughly how many items, and how can we identify the data to be retrieved?"

"For Dr. Rohm, can we get a run-down of her schedule for the next week or so? Is she under any particular surveillance, or just the general Ares employee safeguarding? Is she permitted off-campus at all?"

<span style="font-style:italic">I'm up for either of these runs -- I am assuming the extraction is shootier than the data raid, but maybe that's not the case.</span></p>

  <p>The money's just a bit low for a simultaneous raid against Ares, especially given how much security they're going to have.

  <p>Johnson continues:

Dr. Rohm managed to smuggle us a map of the compound (she tosses over a flek with the data at http://www.henchmonkey.org/shadowrun/extraction/zeta-q.png .

According to Dr. Rohm, there are ten security guards at the compound.  Three each serve on three shifts a day, with the commander checking on each shift as needed.  On each shift, two guards patrol the buildings and grounds, and one monitors security cameras.

The fences around the compound are electrified and there are cameras (thermographic and visual) at each corner and along the length.  There seems to be something strange about the area between the fences, as no one ever goes there, but Dr. Rohm is unable to tell what the area is for.

There are also another reasearcher, two lab technicians, and four support personnel (they handle tasks like cooking, administration, cleaning, etc).

The only things that go in and out of the compound are Wednesday night, when food is delivered and the laundry service arrives, and Thursday night, when trash is hauled away.  Aside from these, nothing enters or leaves.

Security doors (doors facing outside, and the boundaries between areas) all require a card-swipe and a retinal scan for access.</p>

  <p>The data we need is currently in an Ares cyberclinic downtown.  The clinic has low security, so it should be fairly easy to get in and grab the flecks needed.  They'll be in the main office, in the safe, marked with a Zeta and a Q.</p>

Johnson stares off into space.

Are you sure?

Double drek.
</span>

That was my assistant.  We just had our regular contact with Dr. Rohm.  We need to move up the schedule.  We had been hoping to give you two weeks to get ready, but now we'll need to make sure that Dr. Rohm is extracted before next Monday.  Since today is Tuesday, you'd better get cracking.

In light of this, and as my final offer, I'll go to 70,000 Y, you're responsible for any specialists but if you need a recommendation I'll find someone.</p>

Here's a rough scematic of the clinic.  We don't have any data on the security there, I'm sorry to say.

  <p>"Sounds like we're close to a deal, then. We'll need some in advance to pay for arrangements, of course."

<span style="font-style:italic">I'm assuming we're going to discuss splitting pay and planning after the Johnson's gone, but I'll do it here just for simplicity.</span>

"Yeah, I was figuring we'd pool and split the take even -- they're two separate jobs but same broker, and we're all working. Might even be able to do some shared planning, or we can case each other's jobs so we don't have to show up in the area twice.

I guess there's five of us for the two jobs -- seems like we ought to split 3 for the bigger job and 2 for the smaller, although if we could find somebody else for the data pickup that'd be handy.

I think the first thing we should do on both of these is check out the area again. The data'll be easier to get to, but getting away is still going to be tricky -- getting into the compound, on the other hand, is going to be a pain, and getting out is double-pain."</p>

Johnson slides a credstick across the table.

There's 20,000.  Here's my number, call if you need anything or to pass data on to Dr. Rohm.  We communicate with her most evenings.  If there's nothing else, I'll leave you to your planning.</p>

  <p>"Ok, it seems like we're going to want some intel here. I'm going to give Quint a call."

"Hey, Q, how's it going? Yeah, I'm out of town -- enh, long story. Anyway, we've got a gig, and I wondered if you're looking for a little research work. There's this Ares compound here in SF, Zeta-Q. Looks like the only thing they allow in and out are the necessities -- laundry, food, garbage. Can you get us a rundown on those? We'd like to know which companies have those contracts, how many employees they each have, the number of employees they each send on a usual job, what equipment or containers the companies bring in and out, you know. Yeah, I know it might not all be on file -- I figure you can at least pull up an estimate from the employee manual and the kind of service being contracted for. Oh, and see if you can find out if they send the same people every week or different people. Yeah, that should be all for now. I'll give you a call if there's anything else. Lemme know what you can find out. Awesome. 'Bye."

  <p><span style="font-style:italic">From a conversation on #shadowrun:</span>

Thurgun thinks.  "Hmm.  Laundry goes in, food goes in... hey, what if we drug the food they get, and create a medical emergency?  Might be helpful at least as a distraction... oh!  What if it looked serious enough that they needed to call an ambulance--and we're the guys that get called in to deal with it?"

Asher grins.  "We'd have to get Quint to route their call to us instead of... wherever they call.  And I guess find out where they would normally call first."

Thurgun ponders.  "O'i don't know if we could get away with taking her to the 'hospital', or if we'd only be allowed to treat her on-site.  If the latter, I might be able to get Lucy to pretend to be her for a while, under strict 'bed-rest' orders, while we sneak her out in the ambulance.  Good 'til sundown."

"What would we need to make this work?" Asher asks.  "helpful doctor, info about ares security practices, appropriate uniforms, appropriate vehicle, probably some fake ares ids.  That last is going to be tricky."

"Yeah," Thurgun says, "Might be too complex.  But it'd be fun!  We might need a rigger to drive the ambulance.  Maybe overkill, but could be useful, especially if things go sour."  He looks out the window.  "That area between the fences sounded suspicious to me.  O'i think O'ill check there tonight and see if anything looks weird; maybe send one of my spirits in to check it out.  Anyone else want to go with me?"

<span style="font-style:italic">Question:  I made Lucy look like a human in my back-story; that's all well and good, but could I get a spirit to actually impersonate a human for a time?  Wouldn't have to be perfect, just some added realism to what would otherwise be a wig and a bundle of pillows under a blanket.  If we didn't think we could get her out.</span>

<span style="font-style:italic">Also, credit where credit is due:  this idea was probably inspired by equal parts of 'Ocean's 11' and that one episode of 'Firefly'.</span></p>

"I was figuring they're more theoretical than applied medical folks. But even that is going to make it harder to fool them with a fake illness, unless we knock out both the researchers, and maybe the two lab techs. I expect the soldiers don't know much about medicine, so fooling them shouldn't be too hard, if we can come up with some realistic symptoms. Rohm might be able to help drug people on the inside, if we could smuggle in some materials."

<span style="font-style:italic">Either retroactively or next convenient time, I'll talk to the Johnson and find out what she knows about the medical training of the folks there.

Quint:  Hey, man, what's up? ...  Whoa, that's serious.  Let me see what I can turn up, I'll get back to you soon.

A few hours later, he sends you a file:

Compound Zeta-Q.  Obviously not listed under that name, but using the address you gave me it's a small parcel of land owned by Ares Cybersystems, a subsidiary of Ares Macrotechnology, about 20 miles outside of town.  Not much around it except farms and stuff.  Hooked into the power grid like usual, but it's got a weird data hookup.  The lines skip the local grid entirely and go straight into Ares' own grid.  No way to enter it from the outside, you'd have to either break into Ares' network first (major black ice) or get local access from a jackpoint inside.

Anyway, looks like a standard garbage contract with the town.  Pickup Thursday morning, they probably wheel the dumpsters out onto the road (the city refuses to enter private property, y'know?).

The food and laundry service is harder to track down.  Looks like they have a contract with a small local corp, Housekeeping Unlimited, but I haven't been able to get more details.  I'll keep looking, how pronto is this?

Oh, and since we're friends, I'm giving you this up front, but we should discuss the nuyen at some point.</p>

You find it, downtown San Fran.  The block is kind of depressed (a few empty storefronts, a few ones with open stores that don't do much business), the clinic itself is just a blank wall with an unlabelled door.  There's a bargain bin 99Y Store on the right, and a shoe store on the left.  If you didn't know better, you'd think you had the wrong address for the clinic.

Leaning back and looking astrally, you don't see anything on the block.  Turning invisible and watching for a bit, you see one guy (a human) go in.  How long do you wait?

Looking online, you can't find anything about the clinic.  City records don't even indicate the address exists.</p>

Johnson hands you a photo of Rohm.  White, female, mid-to-late 30s, blond, brown eyes, looks to be about 1.6 or 1.7 meters tall.

Johnson says:  Dr. Rohm and her team are performing research surgery.  Dr. Rohm is the main surgeon, but her team also have backgrounds in medicine and surgery and assist in all research.</p>

A few hours after he entered, the same guy leaves.  Seems to be hunched over a little, his aura is showing he's in a bit of pain but not bad.

The adjacent buildings are right up against one another.  You go around the block and find a small alley running behind them.  Where you think the clinic is, it's just a bare wall, no openings.  The clinic is a three story building: the entrance to the upper floors is next to the entrance to the clinic itself.  Looks like apartments or something above it.  No easy way up to the roof that you can see.</p>

How much're these butt'ns, th' ones wi' th' bridge on 'em?

Yeah? That'd be th' C445, then -- I'll take three. Good chip, that. Ver' vers'tile.

Y'know any good place I c'n get lunch around here? Local type stuff, y'know, authentic Cali food.

Quint replies: That's cool, here's the scoop on Housekeeping Unlimited.  Very weak internal security, I went in without blinking.  Your location is definitely a client.  Every Wednesday, at about 3 or 4 in the afternoon, they drive a van (stored in their facility in San Fran) out to the location.  According to the driver's instructions, they wait while security comes out and sweeps the van (checks under the body, pops the hood, looks in the back, etc).

After that, they drive into the area and unload.  The driver and the assistant get everything onto two carts (one for food, one for clean laundry).  The guards rolls those into the building while the driver and the assistant wait outside, then the guards bring back the carts with the dirty laundry and whatever food stuff gets returned.  This gets loaded and the driver heads off again.

Important points: At no time are the driver and the assistant left alone, and the entire process takes maybe 20 minutes.</p>

Hex says:

Cool, I was looking for work.  This sounds doable.  What kind of local access are we talking? Actually break in and jack in, or some kind of wireless repeater, or what?  I'll get back to you on the clinic.

A while later, he sends the results:
Good news, the shoe store next door has a camera pointing out the window in a pretty good direction.  Can't see the actual door, but you see anyone approaching it.

Anyway, looks like the schedule is that two people, a man and a woman, arrive every morning at about 8, then random other people show up, stay for a few hours, and leave.  Never more than two a day, usually one, sometimes none (for the week the camera goes back, anyway).  Then the guy and gal leave at 6, and the place is quiet until the next day at 8 again.

Attached are the best pics I could get of those two, sorry they're kinda blurry, they really skimped on this camera.

Hex says: It's...huh, it's very weird.  Looking that address up in power and telco records shows no mention that it even exists.  Either they've got pirate power and data, or some kind of shady deal with the city and the utilities.

  <p>After a bit more discussion, Thurgun, Emvee, and Asher come up with some basic formula for Operation Sick-em:

-Stage 1:  hack into their system.
Basic plan:  get a wireless repeater inside the compound, have Dr. Rohm plug it in, have Hex do stuff from the outside.
Possible ways to do this:
  - Attach the WR to the dumpster when the trash is picked up.  Have a Field Spirit Concealing it if it's searched.
  - Sneak in the WR with the food (which we plan to subvert anyway).  Same thing with the Field Spirit.
  - Make something go wrong with the electrical system, be the repairmen called in to repair it.  Probably will be watched like hawks; can't use the same person for later raid.

-Stage 2:  Make people sick.
Basic plan:  Make everyone sick, come in as doctors in an ambulance, take Dr. Rohm with us when we leave.
Steps:
-Poison the food that will be used for Friday lunch (get menu from Dr. Rohm).  Poison (bacteria--some sort of food poisoning) is not serious, but symptoms are identical to something that is (research something appropriate, possibly Dr. Rohm will know?).
-Dr. Rohm knows what's up, demands outside medical attention "in case it's serious"
-Hex intercepts call to HQ, makes own arrangements, sends us.
-We drive in, start treating people.
-Either we claim Dr. R. is too sick to treat on-site, or we do a quick substitution of her with a Hearth spirit (while looping cameras, distracting live guards).  Or we try the first and fall back on the second.
-We leave, sirens blaring.  It's possible a guard or two would demand to stay with us; we should be prepared to gas him.  In fact, we should be prepared to gas lots of people ;-)

Later that evening, Thurgun grabs [sunny/asher] and gets a cab to a location about a mile away from the compound, telling the driver to pick them up again two hours after sunset.  They walk as close to the compound as seems reasonable, Thurgun summoning Aunt Marge on the way:

 [shadowrun]  Thurgun says, "And another 3 successes = no drain."</span>

<span style="font-style:italic">I'm basically looking at overall layout, driving approach, a good place to hide Hex/aim the wireless repeater, see what I can see in astral, see if Aunt Marge can see anything untoward, and see if she can tell what's up between the fences.</span></p>

Arriving near the compound, you check out the area.  The outpost is basically a big square along the road, surrounded by fields out to a few hundred meters, and light woods after that.

Sneaking around into the woods, you pull out binoculars and take a look at the fence.  Looking close, you notice that the inner fence has cameras at the corners, swivelling about in a randomized pattern.

The area between the inner and outer fences is empty, except for a small hut-like structure in the southwest corner (not on the map, oddly).  The ground there is noticably scrubbier than the ground outside the outpost or in the inner area.

Looking at the building, you match up with the map and find Dr. Rohm's window.  It looks directly back, away from the road and into the woods.

Checking astrally, you don't see anything immediately obvious in the area.  You send in Marge to check out the outer area.  As soon as Marge enters, you hear a terrifying howl that freezes you in your tracks.  Something large and low to the ground (maybe 1 meter high, but 1.5 meters long and wide) rushes towards the spirit, who stops and comes back.  The something stops at the fence, gives out another howl, and stares directly at you with its glowing red eyes.</p>

Query to Quint, asking for:
  a menu for the week from the food services folks.  Barring that, a list of foods that will be provided.
  a good candidate for a bacteria to dope an item of aforementioned food with.  Must be obtainable, inexpensive, and symptoms must mimic more serious bacterial infection.  Preferentially, it will incapacitate victim for several hours with stomach cramps, etc. and have delayed onset so most of the base will be infected.

Query to Hex, asking if he can get a wireless repeater disguised as any item of food from aforementioned menu, particularly something canned (to  mask the metal signal if scanned).  It should be as inert as possible when not plugged in.  Another option would be to get a repeater that could withstand significant jarring from being shot into Dr. Rohm's window encased in, I dunno, gloop.  (Have to assess the feasibility of that, given the night's reconaissance.  Also would need contact with Dr. Rohm.)

Query to Johnson, asking if we can get in contact with Dr. Rohm today if possible.  If so, ask her about Friday's (or Saturday's) menu, and if she has suggestions about what to dope food with.  Also tell her gist of plan.  And ask her what's up with the demon dog.

<span style="font-style:italic">Tuesday night</span>:

I check to see if the dumpsters are outside in a visible spot, too.  And any markings on the 'Unknown' building?  I presume the unmentioned structure is just SW of the Unknown.  Also, figure out if it's at all feasible to shoot a wireless repeater into Dr. Rohm's window if she's told beforehand to expect it.  Heck, we could toss in a subvoc mike on our frequency.</p>

Hex replies:
I've got a wireless repeater, but I don't have the right kind of antenna.  I have the plans for how to make one, but I'm not very handy with a soldering iron.  You guys know anyone who is?  Disguising it as food is pretty near impossible, it's a 3cm cubic chunk of plastic and metal.  The antenna itself will end up being about 20 cm long and 3 cm in diameter.

Oh, and Quint mentioned you need a way to knock people out, looking like food poisoning.  I know a guy in town who does designer drugs, he can probably bang that out quickly.  Give him a call.

You call Johnson and pass on the questions, she says that she'll have answers for you in a few hours.  A bit later, she calls you back:

Rohm says the menu isn't posted until after the food delivery.  Wednesday's breakfast is almost always a surprise.
Rohm says that if you need, she can try and spike the food, she's got a pretty good supply of nasty chemicals for her work.
The plan sounds okay, although she's not sure what the procedures are if someone in the compound gets sick.  The files aren't accessible to her on the internal matrix.
Dr. Rohm says, and I quote, "Damn, they told me they put that thing down.  Stay the hell away from it."

The dumpsters are just inside the front gate, in the inner compound.  The 'Unknown building', which looks a lot like the really unknown building in the outer area, is pretty featureless except for a heavy door, with chains on the outside.

Dr. Rohm's window is in the western building, looking out over about 5 meters of grass to the inner fence, then 20 meters of grass to the outer fence, and then a few hundred meters of fields to the woods.</p>

Prob'ly want t' keep that f'r a last resort, though, since that c'ld tip th'Corp off ahead o' time 'f we're not careful.

<span style="font-style:italic">To Hex:</span>
So,  huh. You say maybe they're swipin' their services. Did that lead pan out at all? An 'f th'building doesn't exist on record, what about th'apartments upstairs? Are they on th' books? 

What about equipment 'n' supplies 'n' stuff -- is there anyone in th'vid looks like e's makin' a deliv'ry? Oh, an' they're off f'r bits an' spark, but what about water? Gotta have plumbing. There's gotta be <span style="font-style:italic">somethin'</span> goin' in an' out. Do prop'rty records show they exist? Payin' taxes?

Now, they prob'ly got some kinda security system inside. 't'd be nice 'f we c'ld knock it out before we go in. Or at least, not long after. Worse t' worst, I guess we c'n try jus' knockin' out their juice alt'gether, 'f we c'n find out where they're gettin' it from.

Hex replies:
Okay, good idea on the apartments upstairs.  The third floor is normal, but the second floor is drawing way too much power for a residence.  That's probably where they get the juice from.  That apartment (and the entire building) are both owned by Jose Degullio, who (by a wacky co-incidence) is a mid-level executive at Ares.

Checking the videos again, there is one guy who comes in and then leaves about 10 minutes later, about mid-day Friday.  Looks like he was carrying some smallish boxes but it's real hard to tell.

I figured that if they got the power from one of the apartments, they might do the same with data, and it looks like I was right.  I was able to follow the line into the third apartment, which was connected back down into the clinic.  They've got pretty good ice and I'm trying to get past.  Once I'm in, what data do we need?</p>

Most important stuff is th'security they've got set up (cam'ras, metal detectors, what kinda locks they got on th'doors, any super-secret night watchdude who lives in a closet, y'know all that jazz), 'specially what's turned on at night, an' double 'specially an'thin' that might pick up invis'ble stuff.

'Course, 'f there's any data in there on Rohm or th' project, might as well grab that too -- no reas'n t' settle f'r jus' th' hardcopy 'f there's more t' be had.

'm not sure 'f we're gonna be able t' do th'thing at night or f' we're gonna have t' do it th'ard way, so we should check f'r ventillation an' stuff like that, in case we gotta drop by when folks are around -- no windows, so they gotta have somethin', an' that might be a good place t' drop a gas can 'f we go that route.

Hey, I heard you folks're thinkin' about doin' somethin' at mealtime -- if we want these two deals t' go down at th' same time, it'd be handy if y' c'ld schedule y'r shebang some time after six o'clock -- that too late f'r a dinner date? B'fore eight in th' morning might work too, if y'd rather breakfast, so long as there's enough time t' get it all done. But that'd be cuttin' it close.</p>

  <p>I guess stuff's going as smoothly as it can go. I'll check up on the designer drugs, see if they can rush us something, and talk to Quint and Hex about seeing if they can get a line on who this compound contracts with for emergency services (or who Ares tends to do, if they can't find out for these folks -- maybe they can dig up security camera footage around other Ares compounds and see if emergency vehicles have arrived, or check hospitals for reports of Ares workers). Then when we know that I'll look into a rigger (schep's guy) and, with him, look for uniforms and an appropriate vehicle. I don't know how we'd fake the id cards, but, I dunno, maybe we can get semi-appropriate ones from someplace and claim they're new.</p>

  <p>OK, here's my conception of the basic timeline for Operation Sick-em.  Suggestions welcome :

Wednesday:  During the day, we get a syringe full of Listeria dicytogenes (see http://www.answers.com/topic/food-poisoning) and Emvee makes up his antenna.  We plan to sneak in to Houskeeping Unlimited (perhaps invisibly), and substitute a can with Emvee's can, and inject each of Saturday's dinner packets (chicken Kiev) with 1cc each of the stuff.

That night, we make sure Dr. Rohm got the antenna safely ensconced in her room.  We also tell her the symptoms of the bacteria we put in the Kiev, so she can make them worse for herself with her chemicals.

Thursday:  Start gathering equipment we know we'll need to put in an ambulance.  If we can get stats on a typical Ares ambulance, so much the better.
That night, we smuggle someone (Thurgun will volunteer if nobody else will) into the back of the garbage truck with Hex's repeater.  As the garbage is being dumped into the truck, I'll stick the repeater on to it's edge, and possibly tell my Field Spirit to Conceal it until Dr. Rohm comes to get it.  And then to cast Confusion on anyone who gives her trouble.

That night, Dr. Rohm will hopefully be able to put everything together and give Hex access, at which point we see if he can hack into the cameras and find out what the emergency procedure is.  

Friday/Saturday:  We start figuring out what to do to mimic their emergency procedure, including getting a rigger with a rig that can be done up as an ambulance (or, if need be, we can purchase the ambulance separately), and fill it up with typical ambulance-stuff. (We're also working on the other run at this time, presumably).

Saturday night:  Operation Sick-em!

<span style="font-style:italic">Also:  Thursday night</span>

Thurgun tries to calm Marge down and get a good description of the thing what tried to eat her.  Then he calls up Long Feather to see if he knows anything that would fit that description.</p>

You call the guys about the drugs.  For 2000Y, he can get something that'll do the job you want, he says.  Rush job (12-hour turnaround, means snubbing a few of his other clients) will double the price.

Hex says: I dunno about this spot in particular, but most places just use DocWagon.  Once we get into their system we can check and see for sure.

Talking to Hex and Istereth (the new rigger you've hired), it won't be too hard to get a van and decorate it to look like DocWagon (everyone knows what they look like).  Uniforms you can get at any uniform store 9that's where DocWagon employees get them, after all).  IDs will be a bit harder but Hex knows a guy for that, too.

All told, the van (which you have to buy outright) is 10,000Y (and man, is it in cruddy shape), plus another 2000Y for the conversion.

The ID cards are much cheaper, 200Y apiece.</p>

Marge: You saw it! It was big and black and teeth! Teeth! And glowing eyes and it wanted to eat me!

You don't really get much more than that.

Long Feather makes an Int test (he has a 5) with a TN of 6, and gets no successes. He thinks this might be the fabled demon dog of gehennom.</p>

Most important stuff is th'security they've got set up (cam'ras, metal detectors, what kinda locks they got on th'doors, any super-secret night watchdude who lives in a closet, y'know all that jazz), 'specially what's turned on at night, an' double 'specially an'thin' that might pick up invis'ble stuff. I dunno 'f y're gonna be too busy wi' th'other place when the run's actually goin' down, but it'd be good if there's a way y' c'n flip it all off on cue. Or maybe on a delayed timebomb proggie o' some sort?

'Course, 'f there's any data in there on Rohm or th' project, might as well grab that too -- no reas'n t' settle f'r jus' th' hardcopy 'f there's more t' be had.

'm not sure 'f we're gonna be able t' do th'thing at night or f' we're gonna have t' do it th'ard way, so we should check f'r ventillation an' stuff like that, in case we gotta drop by when folks are around -- no windows, so they gotta have somethin', an' that might be a good place t' drop a gas can 'f we go that route.

Hex sends back:
Okay, I managed to get in.  It's a pretty locked down, data-only system.  I don't see much on security.  No camera systems, no lock controls, it looks very stone-age.  It's possible that there's another totally separate security system there, or that there's almost no security at all.  I can't tell which.

I can see the hooks where some kind of advanced biology model goes, but the actual data itself isn't in the system.  I'd guess that the model is what they keep on the chip, and why keep it on the chip and in the computer, right?

I do see some environmental controls here.  Looks like a standard A/C system, the actual cooler units are on the roof and it blows the cold air down from there.  Try looking on the roof, the intakes should be easy to spot.</p>

  <p>Hmm. So here're my thoughts on a plan. We get some gas masks an' a cuttin' torch. We pop a couple gas cans in th'AC, jus' in case there's an'one in there we don't know 'bout. 'Tween my tools an' some old-school picks I'm gonna try t' get t'day, we oughtta b' able t' get in th' front door easy enough, I think. So I blink out an' go in first, t' see 'f they got any eyes on us. 'f I spot an'thin' gadgety, I take it out by hand, then y' c'n join me. 

We go careful room-by-room 'til we get t' th' safe. We pop it open howev'r we c'n, 'n' 'f we can't then we may as well jus' drag it out 'n' maybe invisibilize it up or somethin' when we're out on th' street. Or jus' throw a sheet ov'r 't. Whatever. Oughtta bring a dolly or somethin' too, in case we do gotta take it off t' open it elsewhere. 

Anyway, once we got th'stuff, we fill a rucksack wi' an'thin' else that looks sparkly, then we beat it. How's that sound? We got a little bit of a shoppin' list, but it sh'ldn't be too bad. Nothin' too tricky. We gotta figure a way t' th'roof, though, 'f we're gonna do that part. Any thoughts?</p>

  <p>Sounds good -- I brought my own gas mask, but we'll be needing the other stuff.

Also, can anyone recommend any miniature explosives that will get the safe open right there?</p>

  <p>"Sounds like a pretty smooth plan. If you do end up taking the safe someplace, it might be a good idea to dress up as workmen or something before going on this run, give you an excuse for moving stuff. Maybe that could get you to the roof, too -- claim to be city A/C inspectors and go up the next building, if it's close enough to cross over from."</p>

  <p>Workmen is a good idea -- we should check if the next building over is close enough.</p>

  <p>Yeah, th' uniforms seem like a good idea. Th'folks in th'two shops on either side've seen me, but Tony c'n give it a shot, at least. Or maybe we c'n try on further down th'row. If that doesn't work, let's bring along a rope ladder wi' hooks on one end: th'fire escape oughtta be easy enough t' catch it on, an it's not too far off th'ground t' climb to. It is out on th'street, but it'll be a weekend, so maybe not too many folks'll be out t' watch 'f we're quick. I c'n try t' stun anyone who gets too curious.

Now, we don't got a truck, so 'f we gotta take th' safe off by hand, we'll need some place t' take it. I'll scope out a good alley or two that we c'n duck int', someplace far enough out that we c'n slap on some plastic t' bang th' bolt wi'out gettin' too much attent'n from th' guy upstairs. 

<span style="font-style:italic">So it sounds like the shopping list is: generic workman uniforms for Tony and Emvee, gas mask for Emvee, lock picks, portable cutting torch and battery, dolly, sheet, rucksack, rope ladder with hooks, and a little plastic explosive. Oh, and a pack of cigarettes and matches, since there's no better excuse for a workman to be loitering around on the street doing nothing than a lit cigarette. Am I forgetting anything, in either the plan or the list?</span></p>
