  <p>Dr. Rohm says:

Thanks for saving my bacon: I really needed to get out of there.  You guys ever go to Denver? If you do, and need some 'ware, here's a number.  My friend Dylan doesn't normally take new customers, but call him and mention my name and you're in.

<span style="font-style:italic">You now have access to a bioware and alpha-grade cyberware clinic.  Alpha-grade cyberware is more expensive, but costs less essence.  Bioware is entirely organic (cloned organs and stuff), doesn't cost Essence (it uses another stat called Bio Index, which can't exceed your Body, and still lowers your Magic attribute).</span></p>

Dr. Rohm answers:
We were working on cyberware that is more friendly for the magically adept.  Of course, no cyberware will ever be entirely safe, but it can be reduced.  And, of course, there are ways to not lose any magical abilities at all.  Have you never heard of geasa?

If, spirits forbid, something should happen to reduce your magical power, you can instead keep your power but gain a geas, a condition you must follow.  If you ever break your geas, you lose that power again, until the next sunrise when you follow it again.

<span style="font-style:italic">In game terms, one geas will offset one point of magic loss.  A geas must be a serious restriction on your use of magic.  Common examples are not casting spells while the sun is up, having to use a particular non-focus object (such as a cheap plastic wand), or having to make a particular set of gestures while casting.  If for whatever reason you do not obey the geas, you lose the benefit and act with the lower magic attribute (thus lowering the max force of your spell and the amount of magic pool you can use, etc etc).</span></p>

  <p>Thurgun sits solemnly, listening to the conversation for a while.  During a lull, he leans forward.

"Dr. Rohm.  many of us are from Seattle.  When we were there, we were asked to deal with a problem which turned out to center on a kid who had been... changed.  We dealt with him, but it left us with more questions than answers.  I have here [and here, thurgun rummages around in his bag] an autopsy of that changed individual.  I'm afraid we might have to deal with the situation again when we get back.  Would you mind taking a look?"</p>

Dr. Rohm says:
The world's change to magic is very recent.  Humanity's great enemies are just now starting to reawaken and return.  You should be very careful indeed when you meet one of those ancient enemies.  I can't tell you more than that.</p>

She says:
It's possible, if you know the correct techniques, to create an anchored focus.  When the focus is created, it is imbued with a spell by the creator, and after that anyone who holds the focus may trigger the spell.</p>

"Hunh.  Is it still linked to the person who cast the spell originally?  Do they still experience drain?  Can you change the spell with a similar set of techniques?"  Thurgun looks around guiltily.  "Sorry if O'im askin' too many questions."</p>

"This is not one of my skills, so I can't answer exactly, but yes, the person who enchanted the focus still suffers the drain when it is used, and a connection will always exist between the enchanter and the focus.

Someone with the proper training could change the focus, but he could just as easily create a new one.  Changing an existing one is basically just disenchanting it and then starting from scratch."</p>

  <p>Oh, so there's nothing special about the item itself?  Hmm.  Do you know if they're hard to make?  Expensive?</p>

"Not expensive in physical materials, I think, but I'm not familiar with the process."</p>
