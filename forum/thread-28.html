  <p>About a week after the last run, Sunny gets a collect phone call from Seattle.  It's John, calling her back.

"Look, Sunny, I think I've found a buyer for that info.  But, uh, someone else seems to be interested, too.  I'm not sure, but someone tried to grab me last night outside my apartment.  I'm gonna lie low, but get back here soon, huh? Hopefully we can end this fast."</p>

  <p>"Thanks for the heads-up! Be careful."

Time to get everyone together and figure out our next move.

<span style="font-style:italic">Me, I'm for heading back to Seattle for now, with a trip to Denver after this is all over.</span></p>
