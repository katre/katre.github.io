  <p>Figured we could use the forum as a scratch pad for the clues we find.  So far, that means runes:

ACERERAK CONGRATULATES YOU ON YOUR POWERS OF OBSERVATION.  SO MAKE OF THIS WHATEVER YOU WISH, FOR YOU WILL BE MINE IN THE END NO MATTER WHAT!'

Go back to the tormentor or through the arch, and the second great hall you'll discover.

Shun green if you can, but night's good color is for those of great valor.

If shades of red stand for blood the wise will not need sacrifice aught but a loop of magical metal -- you're well along your march.

Two pits along the way will be found to lead to a fortuitous fall, so check the wall.</p>

  <p>From the parchment inside of the gargoyle's collar:

Look low and high for gold, to hear a tale untold.
The archway at the end, and on your way you'll wend.</p>

  <p>From the corridor at the start of the second session:

DM says, "These keys and those are most important of all, and beware of
trembling hands and what will maul."

DM says, "More runes:"
DM says, "If you find the false you find the true, and into the columned hall
you'll come, and there the throne that's key and keyed."

And next to the fork leading to the archway and to the big devil mouth:

DM says, "Runes: The iron men of visage grim do more than meets the viewer's eye."
DM says, "and the final set, just before the path forks:"
DM says, "You've left and left and found my Tomb and now your soul will die."</p>
