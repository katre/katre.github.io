  <p>Based on our character generation discussion, I've written up and fleshed out my character's stories at:

http://spod-central.org/~lpsmith/rpg/transcripts/conan/iason.html

I should note that they're written from Iason's perspective, so even when he's a guest star in someone else's story, this write-up focuses on the things he did.  If you feel like I've mis-characterized your character, let me know and I can re-write.

On a practical note, here's my list of top skills.  I'm not wedded to this list; if you're interested in one of the skills I have listed and are worried about overlap I'm more than happy to juggle stuff around.  I'm taking 'Mysteries' focusing on knowledge and rituals, so I believe there's room for someone else to take 'Mysteries' focused on something else (like spellcasting for GDorn's guy?)

Superb: Mysteries
Great: Fists, Stealth
Good: Art, Sleight of Hand, Athletics
Fair: Alertness, Survival, Intimidation, Endurance

  <p>Also, if anyone gets my Warel and Amwal ref without googling, I will give them one of my fate points.</p>
