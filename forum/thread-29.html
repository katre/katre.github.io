  <p>"I'm up for heading back to Seattle -- sounds like we got business to finish up there."

<span style="font-style:italic">I'll make inquiries to try and find someone who wants to pay us to run something or someone back to Seattle -- assuming Istereth is driving, we won't need to find someone with a vehicle, just someone with a package. I figure Thaddeus would be a good person to ask if he's not planning on making the run himself, and if he doesn't know anything I guess I'll call Big Jim.</span></p>

  <p>Do people want to actually RP the run back to seattle, or just elide it into the forum? I'm good either way, really.</p>

  <p>Yeah, finding out who might pay for the ride back 's not a bad idea.

<span style="font-style:italic">I'm cool with doing it either way, depending on whether you've got fun ideas for the ride home or not.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-style:italic">I'm also fine to handwave this, I just felt obliged to make the effort to find a gig. Are other people coming along to Seattle or staying behind? I'm a little unclear over how the timeline stuff with the rich recluse guy is working with this call to Sunny.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-style:italic">I'd like to find out whether or not this guy's collection might happen to contain the penny I'm looking for before I skip town.

  <p><span style="font-style:italic">Looks like Emvee's side-quest took about a week, and this call came in about a week after the run, so everything's finishing about the same time.  I'm more interested in spending rp time finding out what's up in Seattle than rp'ing the side-adventure of the trip up there, so unless katre has a particularly cool idea he wants to foist on us, I suggest we say "we find a gig that will pay our way to Seattle, but doesn't give us extra cash".  Maybe someone can roll the find-a-way-to-get-paid-for-driving-cross-country skill.

During the week, Thurgun checks up on the shop, and gets homesick.  While on the phone with Elisa, he also asks if Barker ever showed up for that stock-boy job down the street.  He also continues shopping for appropriate alchemical radicals for he and Emvee.

Also, Thurgun calls it first:</span>

  <p>After asking around for a bit, Thaddeus calls you back.

"Hey, guys, you're looking for anyone who needs stuff run to Seattle, right?  I don't know of anyone here, but there's a guy who needs something picked up in Portland and taken to Seattle.  You guys can get into Tir Tairngire, right?"</p>

Hiding the heavy-duty stuff and the humans, you know of a small highway with a poorly-manned customs station you should be able to get through.  You think you might need a camoflauge cargo in the truck, though.</p>

No humans either, hunh? Good thing it's a big truck. Are there any consumer goods the elves import? Maybe you could pretend to be bringing in a load of cellphones or something (and presumably we'd buy some boxes of those for the truck, plus maybe some more empty boxes to fill up the space).</p>

  <p>"Hmm, yeah, will they allow non-elves in? I know they don't like humans especially, but maybe we can get a temporary visa or something for you and Thurgun. I don't know how big a deal it is for them to let humans in, for that matter -- do you think they'd just take a bribe? And if they won't, and we have to sneak in, are they likely to have a magician working at the border crossing? You said it was poorly manned, so maybe not, but I don't know what's standard. And I guess the last question is working out what cargo we should bring in -- is there anything they want especially?"

<span style="font-style:italic">So I guess Istereth needs to give us some elvish insight here:
 [list] - How hard would it be to get a permit for Thurgun and Emvee in the next week or so?
- Are they really really anti-human there? Would we maybe be able to just bribe the guards to let the humans in if we said we were just passing through?
- Are they likely to have a magician at this border crossing, or do we otherwise have to worry about magical detection as well as a visual inspection?
- What kind of cargo would be reasonable for us to be importing? Something cheap and bulky, I'm thinking, and maybe something smaller and slightly illegal we could pretend to be smuggling in (hence the need to bribe the guards, right) [/list:u:2f55497f17]

  <p>Istereth would say:

With a plausible reason and a little money in the right hands, not too hard.

</div>

The penalties are severe enough that the guards will probably not be bribable, or would require a pretty huge bribe.

</div>

The border force does have a number of magicians on staff, but nowhere near enough to cover every crossing (remember, only about 1%-2% of the population is magical).  It's most likely that the magical guards man the major stations, and the smaller ones do without.

</div>

Technically, all imports and exports from Tir Tairngire go through Seattle.  However, that doesn't stop a few people from driving to California to visit "friends" and coming back with boxes of "presents" for "personal use".  Then as now, Califnornia is big on small personal electronics: music players, phones, pocket secretaries, etc.  The guards will, of course, expect a bribe to not notice the amount of your "personal use" gear.</p>

Seems like Istereth and Thurgun should look into getting permits for Thurgun and Emvee, Emvee and Sunny should look into buying some electronics we can use for cover (and, what the hell, we might as well smuggle in a few while we're at it), and Tony and I will find something to use as main cargo, plus more empty boxes to block off the rest of the truck except the bits where we'll be hiding."</p>

Istereth and Thurgun:  roll any applicable skill (or default to Charisma), TN 4, to get the visas.  The TN is reduced by 1 for every 1000 nY you spend on bribes.

Emvee and Sunny: decide what you want, and then roll Negotiations, TN 4, to get it and set a delivery date.

Tony and Asher: the electronics aren't the main cargo? Taking anything at all from California to Tir Tairngire is smuggling, so there's no concept of 'main cargo', unless you're planning a really elaborate deception, in which case woo hoo.</p>

  <p><span style="font-style:italic">On #shadowrun, we realized that getting from our pickup to Seattle might well be a challenge--why is our contact (Benny, as it turns out) not willing to take whatever-it-is to Seattle himself?  We check things out, and it turns out that with our Seattle Residents cards, we can make it across the border from Tir into SSC easily just by telling them "We're passing through on our way to Seattle," and then the Seattle border folks will just say, "Hello again; welcome back."

Benny is offering 20K for the run, which Istereth pegs as being a bit high, but perhaps not unreasonable, given the difficulties getting into Tir.  We can perhaps negotiate for more once we know our cargo, and/or if we figure out why Benny doesn't want to do the run himself.</span></p>
