  <p>So, we were talking about having an OOC 'leader' for our next foray into the dungeon--do we want to try this?  Another thought was to have two leaders, one for dungeon delving and one for combat.

As an alternative, it might be good if we came up with some general principles for dungeon delving, and some basic agreements for combat.  For example, some principles for dungeon delving might include:

-Mess with almost everything (if there's a lever in a box on the wall, pull the lever unless something indicates we shouldn't)

-Leave the unknown alone (if there's a lever in a box on the wall, don't pull it unless we have some idea about what it might do)

-Try to visit every room

-Quit once we've accumulated [x].

-Don't fight the lich.

-If at any time we want to change one of our adopted principles, that's fine.

Some agreements for combat might include:

-Reach consensus at the beginning of each round as to what the party's general strategy is going to be.  Individual tactics are then left to the discretion of the players.

-We'll try to retreat if the party is reduced to [x]% of its collective hit points and/or members.

-TPK or 0PK--none of this 'escaping with 2/3 the party and never coming back to finish the adventure' stuff.

If we have an actual 'leader' in either or both areas, those are the sorts of decisions I think I'd want them to make--but if we talk about it beforehand, we might not need one.  Or we could have a 'moderator' person whose job it was to say, "OK, enough talk, time to vote".  Or we could just say that anyone could 'call for a vote' if the discussion was circling too much.

At any rate, I think at least thinking about these things beforehand could speed up play later.  Any comments?  Any opinions about the principles above?</p>

I think something in between these two alternatives would be good. Mess with everything, but do it <span style="font-style:italic">carefully</span>, and prioritize. We should do everything we can think of to prepare for any likely traps the lever is likely to spring on us, and we shouldn't do especially risky things when we're low on HP (or otherwise in bad shape).

<div class="bbcode_quote_header">Quote:</div><div class="bbcode_quote_body">Try to visit every room</div>

The IF player in me likes this idea. Barring, e.g., the room full of really huge monsters and lava. So, y'know, that prioritizing again. (We can always come back to those rooms after we've finished everything else in the dungeon, right?)

<div class="bbcode_quote_header">Quote:</div><div class="bbcode_quote_body">Quit once we've accumulated  [x] .</div>

Pfft. No way. If we're going to end the module, why not end it seeing as much stuff as we can? No point in stopping playing unless either we win or we're all dead.

<div class="bbcode_quote_header">Quote:</div><div class="bbcode_quote_body">Don't fight the lich.</div>

This, on the other hand, seems reasonable. Possibly once we get far enough for this to matter (ha ha ha), we'll have some ideas for how to "win" without confronting the big baddie face to face.

<div class="bbcode_quote_header">Quote:</div><div class="bbcode_quote_body">Reach consensus at the beginning of each round as to what the party's general strategy is going to be.  Individual tactics are then left to the discretion of the players.</div>

This seems reasonable, except for the fact that "reaching consensus" is the thing that we're especially bad at.

<div class="bbcode_quote_header">Quote:</div><div class="bbcode_quote_body">We'll try to retreat if the party is reduced to  [x] % of its collective hit points and/or members.</div>

How about "We'll officially consider a 'retreat' plan if the party is reduced to [...]"? As in, if things reach a certain point of badness, we don't continue until we've formally decided together that <span style="font-style:italic">yes, we want to keep going</span>, or <span style="font-style:italic">no, we want to get out of here</span>.

<div class="bbcode_quote_header">Quote:</div><div class="bbcode_quote_body">TPK or 0PK--none of this 'escaping with 2/3 the party and never coming back to finish the adventure' stuff.</div>

I fully agree with this, though. I'm fine with 'escaping with 2/3 the party and coming back later to finish the adventure', but if we're never going to return anyway, why not never return because we're dead, rather than never returning just because we're not idiots? There's no fun in being sensible. 

(Of course, 'never return because most of the players are sick of this deathtrap and have no interest in rolling up new characters' is an alternative, but hopefully one we can try to avoid.)</p>

  <p>That was me. Apparently the forum logged me out when I wasn't looking.</p>

  <p>The main reason I thought a party leader might be helpful was that there were a few times that people were milling around and I felt like I had to push folks to get the adventure moving again.  It's probably especially important if we end up doing any actual play on the forum, since otherwise we'll wait around endlessly for everyone to chime in that they're okay with the next action.</p>

  <p>As far as I'm concerned, if we find the lich and all get killed, that's fine.  I'm not okay with a TPK in any other situation, but if we get to where the lich is, that presumably means we've penetrated his inner sanctum, the deepest, most difficult-to-reach spot in the entire dungeon.  That means we've completed the dungeon, and all there is left is an unreasonably difficult boss fight.  And since I don't intend to use Crumbly again anyway, it doesn't matter much what happens afterward.

As for when to consider retreat:  I'd suggest we consider retreat as soon as we encounter a monster.  Not that we should necessarily flee every encounter, but that we should seriously consider it as an option <span style="font-style:italic">before</span> it kills anyone with a single stroke.</p>

  <p>As for general exploring, last time round we seemed to agree on being SUPER CAUTIOUS and going slowly and trying to check absolutely everything. In fact the only times we got in trouble were when we were slightly less cautious (pit traps, gargoyle).

I say we continue with that, and let Crumbly take the lead (as he pretty much did anyway).

For fighting, hmm, let's give somebody the authority to a) call a halt to discussion, and b) cast the deciding vote. I nominate Jota.</p>

  <p>Sounds good to me!  I second the nomination for Jota as combat leader, and the notion that we muck about with almost everything, albeit carefully.

One thing I hoped for by nailing this sort of thing down in the forums is that in the game, people won't worry about going ahead and doing stuff that's in line with what we've already worked out.  Nobody's going to fuss at you for messing with the box if we've already decided "we're going to be messing with things; just do it carefully."</p>

  <p>Works for me. So, assuming we probably will end up in combat again eventually (even if we do avoid most fights), we should probably pick a set of numbers to signal our "halt and reconsider" point that we're all comfortable with. My suggestion is: one person dead <span style="font-style:italic">or</span> two people disabled <span style="font-style:italic">or</span> four people below one-half HP.</p>
