  <p>OK, April 29th is definitely out for me.  So I guess we're looking at May.

As of now I think I can do any Saturday in May, which are the 6th, 13th, 20th, and 27th.</p>

  <p>AFAIK May weekends will be fine, although May 20-21 is a long weekend here for some reason, so I'll vote against that out of principle.  -- Finn</p>
