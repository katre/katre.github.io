They're able to provide all the ammo, stimpatches, goggles and gas masks you need.

Istereth meets with someone from the Army's Rigger corps, and they find a spider drone ( http://www.henchmonkey.org/shadowrun/spider.html ) with a RPK HMG (40 bullets in the clip, 10S damage, fully automatic, smartlink ready) attached.

An armorer shows up in the evening to meet with Asher and Sunny.  The camo armor isn't a problem, but all of the hardened armor available is for the (all-male) elven army, and, as the armorer says, "Um, miss, you, um, don't, um, fit."  Instead, they provide Light Security armor (6/4), with a helmet (1/2) with built-in low-light, thermo, and respirator.

The grenade link and shock pads both arrive, but both need to go on the same under-barrel mount.  They leave it up to Sunny to decide which to take (she can even take both, but it'll be a 10-minute B/R test to swap them).

The grenades are no problem, although the insecticide grenades are a rush job and a bit tricky.  In game terms, any time Sunny gets knocked around (hit hard enough to take a wound, falls to the ground, jumps behind cover, etc), make a Quickness test with a TN of the total number of insecticide grenades she's carrying.  Any successes means that she managed to cushion them.  Failure means one goes off then and there.</p>
