  <p>When are you free in July?  I leave for a conference at midnight on the 21st and return late on the 27th, so while I am theoretically here for the timeslots on the 21st and 28th, I would prefer not to GM (I expect the conference to be pretty draining; the 21st might possibly work if nobody could make any other time during the month.).  

So, let me know!</p>

  <p>I have every weekend day/evening free right now, except the 28th.</p>

  <p>Okay, I think Rae and Pyotr can be expected to show up the 7th 14th and 28th. But it's still a bit early. And I am not sure. And a part of me thinks being up late potentially on the 7th when we are supposed to bike 15 miles on the 8th might be a bit pushing it. But the 14th definitely looks good.</p>

  <p>Arr, OK, so:  the night after I posted this, we ended up getting booked for the 7th.  That's a lot of Saturdays to remove from the list; how are Sundays for folks?  (In particular, the 8th, 15th, and 29th.  I imagine inky is still out for the 29th.)</p>

  <p>I posted elsewhere, but just to confirm:  We're on for Sunday the 8th at 1:00 pacific, and then Saturday the 14th at 4:00 pacific.  See you then!</p>
