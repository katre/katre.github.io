Wow.
                                                                                     
That leaves a lot to talk about.  Since the Ussurans are somehow communicating with each other, and everyone else can talk to an Ussuran from the party as we sort this out (well, okay, Charles will find Era soon enough), we'll obviously now do a lot of comparing notes and figuring stuff out.  I'll kick things off with what I can recall and summarize.
                                                                                     
Piecing together What Just Happened is the relatively easy part.
                                                                                     
We from the street group can explain that the explosions were prepared by the Bolshev-- I mean, the revolution seeking to overthrow all the nobility and now commencing destruction and arson.  Between Era's bowl and Alix's experience, we can figure out that Wolf is compelling wolves both wild and Pyeryem to attack Pavtlow. And then there's the spirit-skin-sucking vortex.  Don't really know what's up with that.

With the timing so coordinated, looks like Wolf and probably Alexsi are behind all of the above.
                                                                                     
As for what to do now, Matushka's (final?) instructions are going to be the most important factors in Vasili's decisions:
"Keep Ketheryna safe."
"Talk to the four beasts" about Matushka's granddaughter.
"And free that tiger's spirit skin!"
                                                                                     
Number 2 can wait until things have settled down.  Ketheryna seems okay at the moment, with three competent Daughters guarding her and Charles on the way.  Vasili was already headed for the palace to see if there was a need to defend the Gaius and Knias from the revolutionaries.  (It'll take him an extra moment to comprehend that the Gaius is dead, even after that dream.)  I'm not really clear on whether the tiger skin went into the Porte hole, is still trapped in the room, or what.  The wolf message Era heard doesn't sound good for false-Borin, but his whereabouts at the moment are unknown.

So once things start to be understood, Vasili's immediate goal will probably be helping to investigate the tiger skin situation, unless Alix is sure it went in the Porte hole, in which case there's not much somebody with neither Porte nor Pyeryem can likely do about it right now.  Or (especially since Pyotr and I are doing a separate session) maybe we'll just start fighting peasants and/or wolves, or spot blue-eyed "Borin" on the way to the palace, or something even less
expected.</p>

Let's see, a few supplemental remarks:
 
  - I figured the Wolf command was to kill the Gaius, not Borin, but I guess we'll find out.
 
  - Since you didn't mention it, I will remind people that the ice maidens implied that Matushka's granddaughter may be on top of the mountain, although it sounds like we'll need to talk to the beasts to get up there anyway.
 
  - Anyone know what the relation is of the spirit skins of the Knias and the beasts themselves? Is there one? I guess there isn't one if there are four beasts and six-odd Knias.
 
  - Do we have any idea how to get in touch with the beasts? I guess maybe if we find appropriate members of their species (which are what, again? eagle, wolf, something, something?) we can say "TAKE US TO YOUR LEADER"
 
  - I have no idea how people would feel about a Montaigne army coming in to the city, but it seems conceivable they would be helpful in putting down the revolution -- of course, it might just make it double-worse (depending on whether it's a quick victory with the invading army greeted as liberators and the people grateful for the restoration of democracy, eh?)

  - It would be nice to track down Tamara but it doesn't seem like as high a priority as other things.

  - Do we think the bugs tie into this somehow, and/or the forces who Montegue claimed were sabotaging the Ussuran armies? (I guess those might well be bugs also) Or is that some other plot which just happens to be showing up around now too?

  - In terms of keeping people safe, does it make sense to hole up in the city or try to leave? I imagine there's going to be some serious fighting in the streets, so if we stay we're probably going to want to find a safehole -- it might make more sense to try to leave (and take shelter with the Montaigne army?)

In terms of personal priorities, given that Montegue is ok, I think Sebastian's next thing would be to go looking downstairs to try to work out what's up with the magic thing on the room here, both to help Alixandre out and to try to get a clue about who put it there. Then I guess I'm suspicious of Alexsi, so trying to track him down seems like the next thing to do, once everyone in our immediate group is safe.</p>

  <p>[From me:]

Couple things from the GM perspective:
 
As you will find out soon enough, the explosions around the city aren't horrible in and of themselves, but the main problem they represent is fire.  I'm drawing a certain amount of inspiration from:
 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_of_Moscow_%281812%29
 
So that's where things are heading; I'm fine with you all trying any number of approaches here (we've finally reached the end of my 'Hey, I have a cool idea!' stage to 'OK, there's the situation; what do you want to do now?' stage.)
 
As far as which beast goes with which Knias:
 
http://strackenz.spod-central.org/~lpsmith/rpg/transcripts/ussura/season2/reference.html
 
In brief:
Firebird - Tamara
Bear - Koshchei
Cat - Staver
Wolf - Alexsi
 
The drachen skin is gone missing, ever since Pyotr killed Borin.  Usually spirit skins dissipate after their holder dies, but skins that have been bequeathed from family to family for generations sometimes stick around longer.  You figure the skins for the Kniases would be particularly hardy.
 
The position of Knias is usually determined by heredity, but confirmed by the spirit skin.  (The skin is bound to the new Knias in a ceremony shortly after the old Knias dies.)  In some cases where there was a dispute (the old Knias left no direct heirs, and there were a number of equally-related cousins, for example), there is a special ceremony where the spirit skin itself is called upon to choose.  If you all want to replace Borin in Somojez with someone, getting them decked out with the drachen skin would legitimize their claim (and probably silence any doubters).
                                                                                     
(Er, this doesn't necessarily relate to the immediate problem here, but is stuff almost all of you know, whether through your diplomatic readings, or because you live here.)
                                                                                     
Oh, right--but the same is true of the Snow Tiger ('the great Arkanun tiger', according to the book, which I forgot to write down beforehand but there you go).  If someone manages to bind the tiger skin to himself before it gets a chance to leave and find the person Matushka has chosen, that would legitimize any claim on the throne he might make as well.
 
Also, I realized after the fact that I was sort of pushing for the GM-imagined solution to the problem of the spirit skins in the treaty room, and of course we should instead go with whichever solution you guys want to pursue.  So, feel free to either go with Montegue through the Porte hole and try to herd the skins through that (which might have repercussions of its own), or you can stay behind and try to undo whatever sorcery is keeping them from leaving this place before whoever did this comes back to claim them.
 
 
Finally, we should chat at some point about how much further you all would enjoy taking the campaign in general.  If you like, I have one idea that would take you all over Thea for maybe 3-4 'seasons' before culminating in a climactic finale back in Ussura, at which point things would wrap up.  (We'd take breaks between seasons for other games, of course.)  Or we can take a break after this bit's done, and go straight to the finale when we do season 3.  No need to answer this right away; feel free to ruminate ;-)
 
Thanks again, everyone!  I've been having a lot of fun GMing.</p>

Well, hmm.

Somojez is south of here and features the really big mountain.  And Borin is more literally an "imposter".  So that's where I got that idea.

I thought Montegue meant there was sabotage within the ancient bug ranks.  I haven't had the feeling yet that the bugs are involved in the Wolf stuff.  My best guess at their aim is they were helping the Montaigne army so that there would be as much Porte happening in Ussura as possible.
 
When we get around to looking for the beasts, Tamara is probably the first person to ask.</p>

Okay, I think we shouldn't underestimate the "protect Keth" command, since she is pregnant. I think we are going to discover there's an actual plot against her and with the unborn child, it's even more important. So whatever we do, we need to make sure she is under vigilant protection - none of the whole "sure, the Sophia's Daughters will take care of her" and just leave her off-stage with NPCs.
 
I was thinking the south-mountain had to be significiant. Is Somonez the one where we met the ice-maidens, and Palech took us to the old battlefield, and stuff?

Or do we need to backtrack all the way to where we first got that wolf-bowl in season 1?

It doesn't seem to me yet that the bugs have any interest in Pyerem or Ussuran politics, but perhaps they are working with the "original" forces, the beasts, to take control? Perhaps the whole sabotage and peasant rebellion is inspired by a bug in disguise?

Also, if the new Gaius is from the peasantry, and the peasants are rebelling, this is going to get messy. Do we have any loyalty in trying to help the new Gaius?

Having the Montaignian army approach the city just seems more problematic to me, since the riots are happening with the rumor that the nobles are handing over the city to the foreigners. Doesn't the army approaching the city pretty much *validate* those rumors? I don't think the army is going to be welcomed as liberators. Can't we keep them in reserve? Have Montegue camp just over the next hill or something, so out of sight of the city, but nearby unless we really end up needing assistance.

I guess if we are sticking the spirit skins into a Porte hole, the first step for Raelynn is to really get those Porte lessons.

One thing I didn't understand - is the skins leaving happening only to those in the room where the negotiations were happening? Or are people all over the city/country losing their skins and the Wolves taking over? I am wondering since Era's skins seem fine.
                                                                                     
And why is everyone so focused on Alexsi? I haven't seen the log yet - but is he really the type to send the peasantry to riot? The riots seem like it was planned in advance - and he didn't know how the negotiations would go. Are you all thinking that he came into the room expecting to sabotage? I am wondering if Alexsi is another bug.

Those are all my thoughts at the moment.

Ok, point. Although why do they need to take him out if he's an imposter?  I guess maybe they're maneuvering to get somebody else more friendly to their cause into the Knias spot there, or just throw it into chaos. But the situation's already pretty chaotic.

Looking back at the logs Montegue says "I did not get this far without help." which sounds to me like it means his invasion, but it basically comes out the same. (I figured it was bugs sabotaging the Ussurans since it'd be easy for shapeshifters to do so.) Your appraisal of their motives seems pretty reasonable; it's also possible they're using the invasion as a distraction while they do something else.
 
> When we get around to looking for the beasts, Tamara is probably the first person to ask.
 
Good point, I guess this raises the priority of finding Tamara (or Koshchei, but he seems harder to find).

Yeah, I guess we'll have to take her with us whatever happens. I hope she's early enough along that she can still ride a horse (I guess Era's mom would scoff at this).

Ok, looking at http://www.tlucretius.net/7thSea/Maps/Map_Ussura.htm, it makes sense that Borin of Somojez is the "south-mountain imposter", since Somojez is way in the southwest.
 
But that's not where Mount Ostrog is -- it's in the Gora Sorivdgrastov mountains near Pavtlow. The wolf-bowl mountain is, I believe, in the south-east, since I think Tamara's province is Gallenia and it's in the north part of that.

I guess we'll have to hope Matushka doesn't give it to anyone who hates us too much. But I expect the Ussuran members of the group do feel some loyalty to the new Gaius, whoever he/she is, as the "official" ruler of the country. (I admit it would be interesting to have the new Gaius be a damn-the-aristocracy type, but it seems like that would lead to horrible times for the country as a whole.)

Ok, good point. So scratch that idea for now (maybe Montegue can still be useful if Alexsi decides to send troops to Pavtlow or something).
 
> And why is everyone so focused on Alexsi? I haven't seen the log yet -
> but is he really the type to send the peasantry to riot? 

It's certainly possible that he's been replaced, but note that he's had an on-going feud with Ilya (the ex-Gaius) because his father killed Ilya's father. Also, it definitely looked to Alixandre and I like Alexsi staged an argument as an excuse to dramatically stomp out of the meeting; so right now my take is he came in to set up some spell on the area, then left before it took effect, and had also arranged for some rioting and explosions to go off at the same time.
 
I'm not sure what happens now -- I guess he must be trying to steal the Tiger skin from Ilya and bind it to himself, which (based on Lucian's last message) would make him the new Gaius.
 
Actually, this means that if we hold onto the Tiger skin ourselves, we're effectively the ones who pick the new Gaius, unless Matushka comes to take it away from us.
 
Maybe we should give it to Montegue.</p>

Based on what we've seen, my reading is that Alexsi has been sabotaging the defense, to let Montegue get closer to Pavtlow, in order to force the Gaius into action and let Alexsi start his plan to take over from the Gaius.  It's a bit underhanded, but it seems in character with what we've seen.</p>
