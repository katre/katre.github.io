  <p>Is this Saturday (the 18th, if I can count) a possible date for the next session? I know that Sargent was considering running DitV, but I'm not sure if that's just a contingency plan in case there's no Tomb. 

If this Saturday is bad, what's the next Saturday that would work for people? I seem to recall lpsmith saying that the following two were no good for him.</p>

  <p>I thought there was something preventing this Saturday.

Regardless, I'd be better served taking at least one weekend's break from Tomb.</p>

  <p>lpsmith is gone 2/25 and 3/4.  I'm gone 3/18.  So how about 3/11?  Someone had said that the XYZZY awards were 3/11 but it looks like they're 3/12 instead.</p>

  <p>I don't think I have anything scheduled that far ahead, so I should be good for then.</p>

  <p>The 11th isn't the *best* day for me, but it will work.  The following weekends in March seem to be fairly free.</p>

  <p>I'll be off-line until probably March 5th; feel free to make decisions on the forum without me.</p>

  <p>AFAIK, most of March should be good.  March 4-5 might be a bit dicey as it contains my birthday, so will quite possibly have family-type things.</p>

  <p>I am out 3/5 and 3/11. I am potentially available 3/18 or 3/25.</p>

  <p>If Sargent is out on 3/11, and dfan is out on 3/18, I guess that makes 3/25 the next possible day. I don't have any current plans for any of my Saturday afternoons in March, so that'd be fine with me (although it's a bit far off).</p>

  <p>OK, it looks like the possibilities are

<span style="font-weight:bold">3/11</span> YES: Jota, Roger, lpsmith; NO: Sargent; ?: baf, Iain

<span style="font-weight:bold">3/25</span> YES: Jota, Roger, lpsmith, Sargent; ?: baf, Iain

So let's make it the 25th unless both baf and Iain can do the 11th but not the 25th.

Meanwhile, if people want to make progress on the forums, that is swell, otherwise we can wait.</p>

  <p>If we're looking at five-person groups, what was the status of 3/4?</p>

  <p>I am available every weekend for the forseeable future.</p>

  <p>Iain says he can do March 25th, so that is the official date for session 3.</p>
