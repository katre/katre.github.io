  <p><i>[I'm going to fast-forward through some exposition and some time here; feel free to add questions or other stuff you want to have done in the meantime, and correct me if I got one of your actions wrong ;-]</i>

Over the course of the next day, Sebastien lazes around in the hospital trying to stop bleeding or something, and Charles is released and told to 'take it easy', which he almost manages to do.  Those of you mobile enough to wander around town do so, trying to pick up more clues about Vienne and Nicolette.  It turns out the city watch is doing the same thing, as the two of them have been associated with some sort of crime scene at the docks, as well as an arson and a murder in a shop uptown.  They manage to track down their one good lead... and question the three of you.  [You can either disclaim any knowledge here, or tell them what you know; at this point your role in what's happened at Kem has reached them, and they're inclined to believe you.  If you decide to tell them what you know, they'll share with you what they know (which probably isn't much more than what you've gleaned already), and promise to keep you updated if any new information arises.]  In the evening, a traveler arrives from the east who claims to have met a group of two women and "the largest man I've ever seen" on horseback going away from the city.

The next morning, a shout arises from the docks:  a fleet of ships, heading south!  And indeed, it's the bulk of the Montaignian army, piloted by the rescued captains, and manned by flustered armymen-turned-navymen.  With them is Borin (nee Valerii) and Ketheryna, along with her maid (Leonora).  Ketheryna is beginning to regret choosing to go with the ship group, as morning sickness combined with seasickness is not a pretty sight, but she knows it's the fastest reliable way back to St. Andresgorod.  Within hours, the city is abuzz with the news:  Ketheryna's eyes have turned green!  She's been granted Pyeryem!  Opinion is somewhat divided as to whether this is a good thing or not (some believe it's Matushka's withdrawal that has allowed a foreign-born woman to be granted such a holy gift) but she has always been well-liked by the peasantry, and the majority are glad for her.

Borin again wants to be left behind, and argues passionately that he can do more good here as a merchant (something he knows how to do) where nobody knows him, but close to Aleksi, so he can keep tabs on what he's doing and pass on messages.  [Despite his arguments, he'll do what you tell him, here.]

Montegue is not with the ship group, having elected to stay with the land-based army that wouldn't fit on the ships, refusing to abandon his men.  Alixandre is becoming his right-hand man for the trip, negotiating with the cities and towns they've come through to better and better effect.  The next day after the ships leave, Montegue arrives, and Alixandre makes a beeline for the hospital, where Sebastien is still recovering.  Sebastien teases him about his outfit, which is much more Ussuran than it was the last time they met.  Alixandre is embarrassed to admit that the more Ussuran-looking clothing makes the Ussurans receive him better, and that he needs all the advantages he can get.  "But look!" he says, standing up.  "This style vest has five pockets!"  "You don't mean--"  "Yes!  *Five handkerchiefs*!"

In the evening, Pyotr is restless, and takes a walk down by the docks and watches the fog roll in.  Suddenly, there's a *twist* in the fog, and a now-too-familiar voice speaks to him.

"You are not searching for a way to awaken me."

<em>[Here, the GM spends a drama die.]</em>

Pyotr:  So we've been busy.  And?

Drachen spirit skin:  Shall I find another to do what you cannot?  Puny human, you are ceasing to amuse me.

Pyotr:  Yeah, well you ceased to amuse me a long time ago.  I'm sick of you laughing at me when I'm trying to sleep.

Drachen:  Heh heh heh.  Attend, mortal.  If you do not find a way to awaken me, I--

At this point, the wind picks up from the ocean, and the fog in the *twist* uncoils and spreads out over the bay.

Drachen (faintly):  Crap!

Pyotr laughs heartily at this, and reports on what happened to the others.  Era ponders a bit, and says, "It's not as strong as it used to be.  It's falling apart.  If it falls apart completely, the link between it and the Drachen will be severed, and the Drachen will start to die.  A creature will live forever as long as its spirit skin lives on.  That's part of the bargain with Matushka.  I bet it's scared.  We have some leverage here, though we don't want it to go to Wolf for help, either."</p>

  <p>I guess I've nothing against telling the proper authorities a simple version of who we are (good guys, helped with the peace talks, trying to stop the people who tried to stop the peace talks, that sort of thing), if no one else objects. 

Which direction were the people on horseback riding? If it's out of our way, is it a direction Rae can get to easily with her unPorte? If nothing else, we should probably make sure the KemKops know about them.</p>

  <p>Vasili is cooperative with the city watch.  "But honestly, we weren't quite prepared for them.  If Montegue's troops can catch them fast, great.  Otherwise, I'm afraid they escaped this time."

"Valerii, you're not anybody's prisoner.  We just wanted to make sure you understood the dangers and had the protection you need before you ran off alone.  If you want to start something here, good luck, and let me know if I can help before we leave."

In chatting with random people at the tavern, Vasili assures them that he heard Matushka speak well of Ketheryna when she met with her people.

Vasili is rather agitated at the story and conjectures about Drachen-skin, and wants to get back to wandering through the wilderness ASAP.</p>

  <p>They're traveling east (inland).  I don't believe Raelynn has any blooded items that way (I think she has two with her, plus the arrow-inna-bughead?)  She also went up in Blooding, so can now blood an additional item, according to rules I recently invented ;-)

Valerii thanks you profusely, and looks into business opportunities here in St. Tremult.  There doesn't seem to be any current upper-class tailor shops around...

  <p>Sebastien is restless and sore in the hospital, but on the other hand, clean sheets! New handkerchiefs! He occupies himself swapping stories with the attendants and brooding over what exactly he is going to do when he tracks down Vienne and Nicolette, and how he is going to deal with Breck.

Once he's feeling well enough to ride a horse again, Sebastien is perfectly amenable to heading south for the drachen -- presumably it'll take a bit of time for V&N to get their schemes in motion again, and more time for them to head back to Montaigne.

(Also, wrt the drachen, weren't the other people in the group theoretically researching thrice-tenth kingdom stuff and waking the drachen? Did they get anywhere with that?)</p>

The main thing you have discovered is Lande's story of <A HREF="http://strackenz.spod-central.org/~lpsmith/rpg/transcripts/ussura/drachen_snow_maiden.html">The Drachen and the Snow Maiden</a>, which (if accurate) seemed to indicate that the potion used to put him to sleep in the first place came from the thrice-tenth kingdom, the antidote would also be from the kingdom.

Last time you visited there, you just headed into the thickest part of the woods and there you were.  That might work again; the other traditional method of getting there is with an animal guide.  You also heard rumors that the way the Fhideli clans get around Ussura so quickly is that they know their own ways through the thrice-tenth kingdom.</p>

  <p>Yeah, Pyotr is ready to head to St. Andresgorod, now that we've dealt with all the problems with the Montaignian army.

I think the best way is to go find that rabbit again, get his help to enter the Thrice-Tenth Kingdom, and see if we can find a way to awaken the drachen while we travel.</p>
