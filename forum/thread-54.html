  <p>As you guys can tell, you're getting pretty near to Crumbli's pants.  Maybe we can finish this off with one more session, especially if you make a little more progress in the forums.

How's May 20 or May 27?  June 3 is out for me, and I suppose I could do May 13 if that's all that worked.</p>

  <p>I would prefer the 27th to complete Tomb of Pantlessness.</p>

  <p>A few more people spoke up on the mud when I prodded them.

So for May 27, we have Sargent, lpsmith, probably Roger, probably Jota  and probably Iain, and I haven't heard from baf yet.  That's good enough for me.</p>

  <p>Whoops, it turns out I won't be able to make the 27th.  I'm perfectly fine with you all playing without me; just know that if you happen to come across a floating skull, Rosie is completely unable to damage it, so either have her a) try to run through and find Crumbli's stuff/mess with his phylactory, b) grapple, c) die as a distraction, or d)run away!</p>
