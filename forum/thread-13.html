  <p>It appears that we've pretty much finished what we need to do in Kem, so it's probably time to move on. We've learned that "Vienne and Nicolette" (presumably LaVache's agents, and possibly the Porte sorcerers who helped set off the explosions) are going to be in St. Tremult waiting for extraction. That seems to be more or less on our way, so should we stop in to see if we can get anything good out of the two ladies before we continue on south to the castle?</p>

  <p>Yeah. And when we're done with them, we can turn them over to Montegue's guys. (Not sure if Montegue is going to be coming south with us to the castle or not, but he might send a squad, at least.)</p>

  <p>So!  Here's what you all found in the yacht:

-The aforementioned cork, sitting possibly deliberately in a shadowy corner.
-A sort of metal whistle with a single stop (hole to change the pitch).  This seems to have fallen out of V or N's pockets during the struggle.
-A case of vials similar to the one N threw at Sebastien (empty).
-Papers:
  - a bill of sale for 'infused oil of vitriol'
  - A few pieces of paper with scrawled symbols, notes, and seemingly random syllables on it.  ("increased attunement?"  "so ri to shal" "need more subjects!")
  - Another piece of paper on nice stationary covered neatly with two-letter 'words', as if someone had taken graph paper and filled in the squares with two letters each.  This resists all attempts to decode it, until Charles remembers something:  "Wait, now I remember!  Emet said that LaVache would sometimes send coded messages to Devoe directly, using a system that sounded similar to this.  The first step to decoding it was to take each 5x5 section, and read out the letters in a particular order.  Let me see if I still have the thing he gave me... <rummage rummage> Ah, here it is!"

Charles pulls out a piece of paper that has this written on it:

01 06 07 13 14
02 15 16 08 17
03 18 19 09 20
04 21 22 10 23
05 12 11 24 25

You try out this system on the paper you found, but while the number of columns and rows do both turn out to be divisible by five, following Emet's pattern doesn't help you decode anything; it still ends up as gibberish.

Also, it's a busy night at the hospital where you take Sebastien--several people are brought in for treatment for burns and smoke inhalation from a fire that seems to have started in a tailor shop.

Pyotr and Charles hang out by the docks that night to see if anyone re-appears.  In the early morning, a woman, whistling cheerily but entirely tunelessly, makes her way down the pier to the boat and hops on deck.

[and here we pause to see if you want to do anything--we can finish this bit up on the forum.]</p>

  <p>Is it possible to guess from context whom the coded message is for/from? E.g. from the handwriting (masculine or feminine?), whether or not it looks like it's already been delivered, if anything else is written on/near it, etc.

In any case, I'd likely try other patterns of numbers similar to:

01 14 15 16 10
02 06 17 18 11
03 19 07 20 12
04 21 22 08 13
05 23 24 25 09

Or:

01 02 03 04 05
10 11 06 12 13
14 15 07 16 17
18 19 08 20 21
22 23 09 24 25

Until I run out of likely patterns (N, V, T, P, L...) or hit on the answer.</p>

  <p>A-ha!  The 'N' pattern works well enough to solve the subsequent letter substitution cypher, and text begins to emerge!  But half of it seems to be garbled.  It starts off normally enough, then slips into garbled letters (maddeningly nigh-recognizable), then back again, and so forth.</p>

  <p>Is it as if it's switching to a different key (such that trying V, or finding out N's last name for those parts might work), or is it a different sort of garbling? Also, do we have any rendered plaintext yet at this point?</p>

  <p>Indeed, it is exactly as if switching to a different key will work, a fact you work out when trying 'N', 'V', 'N', 'V', etc. reveals the following message:

<blockquote>Apologies again for stranding you--even with all your objects, still might not be enough to destroy whole fleet.  Return when you can; may receive help from unanticipated agent.  Not sure he's trustworthy; should know 'Crimson' counter-sign.  Or may stay if you wish--A. claims anti-Porte entity dealt with, so should have unblemished tapestry and no interference here.  Know you complained of shredding in Montaigne.  Send key to me for quick escape if so, and report back within the month either way.  Contacts in St. Tremult:  tailor on Vine st.; Boar's Head Tavern.  Contacts in Ekaternava:  hairdresser on the waterfront; Snow Leopard Inn.  Not much elsewhere in U.; A. claims St. Andresgorod v. important to him; inclined to let him hang, but feel free to help if he offers enough.  Try Yuri Petrovich if so; old contact, but may still be active.

Including the whistle you requested, against better judgment.  These forces are chaotic and can rarely be bargained with, but never controlled.

Do try to be discreet, my dears.  The people of Ussura are simple, but also traditional.  Hiding in plain sight works sometimes, but not always.

  <p>Oh!  I forgot one other thing you found on board:

  - One pair of pants.  In one pocket is a well-worn silver coin.</p>

  <p><i>[ussura] Jota says, "I think I should probably disguise myself when I see her boarding. And then show up after that."</i>

As the woman slips onto the ship, Charles slips into an alley to disguise himself, leaving Pyotr to watch.  The woman disappears inside, and a half-minute later, you both hear an ear-splitting shriek!  Followed by a round of inventive cursing in Ussuran.</p>

  <p>And then, of course, we rush in to see what the matter is! Not bothering to immediately identify ourselves, as she is clearly distraught, and calming her and finding out what is wrong is clearly more important.</p>

  <p>You rush in to find the woman alone in the cabin.  "Hey!  Get off my ship!"  When you explain you heard the shriek and only came to help, she calms down a bit.  "Here I am, scheduled to ferry three rich passengers today, and there's blood all over my floor!  What in the name of Matushka's sagging <edit> is going on!  I thought the Montaignians leaving meant that things would calm down around here!  Sheesh, the investigation alone is going to keep me stuck here a week.  Not that I'm moving anyway before I know some Porte-addled nut isn't going to show up and kill me in my sleep.  <grumble grumble grumble>.  Thanks for the help; I gotta go talk to the watch."</p>

  <p><i>[ussura] Jota asks, "Is the bill of sale for someone in St T?"
[ussura] lpsmith says, "Yeah, from about a week ago."
[ussura] Jota says, "I guess we could check on that."</i>

The guy at the alchemist's shop remembers the sale, since it was for so many vials of the oil.  He describes the buyer as a woman of about Vienne's build, but with brown hair instead of blond, and guesses she was in her 40s instead of late 20s (as it seemed to you).  He refuses to reveal what exactly it's infused *with*, but claims that on contact with air, it will burst into flames, and that wood shavings are particularly susceptible to being set on fire as a result.

He then tries to sell you stuff.</p>

  <p>Checklist of stuff to do before leaving St. T:
  - Make sure all injured heroes check in with a physician
  - Check on the place where the bill of sale came from
    * what is "infused" oil of vitriol?
    * did they buy anything else?
    * is there any other info we can get there?
    *** can they sell us any cool alternative stuff to fill the pin with?
  - Possibly help clean up the porte mess in the yacht?
  - Anything else?</p>

  <p>Stuff to buy from alchemist: liquid smokescreen we can fill the amulet with. Some vials of infused oil of vitriol for ourselves, in case we need a handy fire grenade thing at some point. Anything else?</p>

  <p>Vasili says, "Somehow I doubt they're far.  If they had items back in Montaigne, they wouldn't have needed this ship."  He finds a small empty barrel and closes the cork inside it.  "We can't guard that thing all the time, and who knows what other 'experiments' they might have ready if they do try coming to it.  Maybe Gaspard knows of some sneaky things to do with your enemies' blooded items.  Or we can just tie it to a rock and sink it."</p>
