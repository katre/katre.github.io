  <p>In the Columned Hall... of Horrors!

I'd like to draw a Canary from Clem's bag of tricks and toss it toward the big, glowing, benevolent-looking orange gemstone.

  <p>Paulie extracts a bat (as always) from the bag and tosses at the big orange gem.

The bat lands on the gem and looks around expectantly.</p>

  <p>Crumbli is going to take her life in her hands and actually pick up the sceptre on the throne.  If nothing untowards happens, she's going to touch the crown with the gold end.</p>

  <p>Crumbli gingerly picks up the scepter, and gently touches the crown with its gold end.

Nothing happens.</p>

  <p>OK, then I tap the compartment with the silver crown draw on it with the silver end.</p>

  <p>As Crumbli touches the silver end of the scepter to the silver crown inlay, the throne sinks into the ground, revealing a 5-foot wide passage to the south!

It looks like it goes for 20 feet or so and then opens up into a larger area; that's all you can tell for now.</p>

  <p>South is the right direction for my equipment (or 'pants', as it is apparently called in Common).  I'm going to put the sceptre carefull back on the throne where I found it (taking care to get it the right way around) and go through the crawlway.  No need for anyone else to follow just yet.</p>

  <p>A clarification: it's not really a crawlway, since it's tall enough to walk through comfortably, it's just narrow.

After 20 feet the narrow passageway opens into a small 10' by 10' foyer, which has a large set of stairs going up at the other end, fanning out to be 30 feet wide at the top, where there is a large set of double doors.

The steps, wall, and ceiling of the stairwell are each apparently forged from a separate precious or semiprecious metal.

A bronze key lies on the fourth step.

The double doors are huge (15 feet wide, 30 feet tall) and appear to be made of solid mithral.  Where they meet, at about waist height, there's a hemispherical concavity with a hole in the middle.

  <p>With my detection spell a-going, I walk through the passageway to join Crumbli and check the magicness of the stairs, doors, and key.</p>

  <p>The stairs don't appear to be magical.

The doors are overwhelmingly magical; no reading on the school.

The key has an overwhelmingly magical aura of enchantment.</p>
