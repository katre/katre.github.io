  <p><span style="font-style:italic">After Tony and Emvee get back and sleep off what they can, Emvee gives a shot to healing them both up.

 [shadowrun]  Emvee rolls 13t4: 4 5 5 4 1 5 5 3 5 4 2 2 2 | 8
 [shadowrun]  Emvee rolls 7t2: 1 1 4 3 6+4 5 2 | 5

He heals himself with no trouble and no drain.

But can only manage one box for Tony, because of all that nasty 'ware clogging up his system. He has to spend five days in the hospital (for 1000nY) and three and a half resting up afterward to get back to full health.</span></p>

  <p>Hello from the hospital -- they reckon it'll be another few days, and I'll need another few at home to get back up to full. I don't know when you all will be wanting to head back, so let me know, ok?</p>

  <p>"I figure we can stick around here for that long -- we'll want to see if we can find somebody who'll pay us for the run back to Seattle, anyway. Maybe Istereth knows somebody. Speaking of cash, though, I'm wondering how we made out on this run. Here's how I figure it for our run:

Base pay: 70k

Run expenditures:
Drugs for tainting the food: 4k (2k base, 2k for a rush job)
DocWagon van/uniforms/paint job: 12k
ID cards: 800nY (200 each, *4)
Quint's assistance: 3k

Run extra income:
5 uzis resold (probably @300 nY each, half the street price)

Net profit: 51.7k

Seem right? Kinda heavy on the expenses, but I guess you gotta spend money to make money. I'd offered Hex a full share back when I thought he was going to be on-site with us -- if folks want to negotiate that down with him to a half-share because he ended up not going into the compound, that'd be the same deal Quint was getting earlier."</p>

  <p>The chips you picked up: all are standard data-flecks.  Two have the Zeta-Q logo on them, the third is unmarked.

The boxes are very similar.  One is labelled "&#946;-Datajack", the other is labelled "&#946;-Memory - 100 Mp".</p>

Looking at it astrally, it reminds you a lot of that Increase Reflexes sustaining focus you have.  Also, for some reason, the word 'speed' comes into your head a lot.</p>

  <p><span style="font-style:italic">Minus 1k nY for Tony's hospital stay, plus the actual 20k nY for the data itself. So I think that brings us to 68.1k, plus whatever we get from re-selling the extras we found.</span>

I looked around on th'Matrix, an' I think this "beta" thing's s'posed t' be top shelf 'ware -- an' a hundr'd Mp? I think we're ont' somethin' good. Unless s'meone wants t' count it 'gainst their cut, I think we c'n get a pretty sweet pile o' n'yen f'r it. We sh'ld shop th' morphium around too. 

These other parts I got, they're pretty standard 'puter bits, so's prob'ly not worth th' trouble o' sellin' 'em off -- mind 'f I hang ont' 'em in case we need spare stuff later on?

Now, 'bout that lion thingy... I don't know that I trust it. May be nice t'ave around, but... I don't wanna get caught by 'n Ares power-Mage comin' back f'r 'is toys. 'f we 'ang ont' it, I think we oughtta try t' break that bond ASAP.

I agree we don't want to give Ares any leads on us after what we just did. Is there any way we can hide the thing without breaking the bond in case we want to track it down later? Like, put it in a lead box or something?</p>

OK, it looks like if O'i break the enchantment on this, it's not made of anything that O'i can use to make a new one I couldn't find cheap somewhere else.

But as it is, it's probably worth something to Ares.  We can't sell it to them directly, of course, but we know that one fixer guy in town who might be interested.  Asher, you want to give him a call?  You seem to be better than O'i am at getting people to give us more yen.</p>

Sunny's really the negotiation type -- I'll pass off to her, if she's up to it. But before she tries, maybe I'll spend a day or two trying to research the lion symbol. Maybe it's some kind of secret society or something.

Dropping off the model, you feel a sense of peace and well-being.  You get one point of Karma.

You manage to get the modern street location of the shop, and head by.  There's a small junk store there, called Wildes'.  Going in, and asking some questions, you learn that a) the store is run by Kelly Wildes' grandkids, and b) the entire coin collection was sold off to a rich collector about 30 years ago.</p>

You spend some time on the matrix terminal, and turn up an early-21st-century novel by someone called Dave White called <span style="font-style:italic">The Lions of Malta</span>.  Apparently it's about some cult on the island of Malta in the early medieval era, who wore lion pendants to prove their membership to each other.  Apparently they guarded an ancient and terrible secret which, many readers of the book believed, was ACTUALLY REAL.  There is nothing else anywhere on the matrix about the Lions of Malta, except for more references to this book.</p>

The owner says, "Hmm, let me see if I wrote it down.... Oh, yeah, old Byron Halseth bought it all.  He used to come by once a week, looking for stuff for his collection.

The coin was sold to a man named Darius Jagow, who lives in Denver.  According to the records, it was auctioned in Miami by the estate of Laventa Pique.

Halseth apparently made a lot of money a few decades ago as a proto-decker (pre-deck, even, so he was just a hacker).  He was involved with the early attempts to create the modern Matrix, cyberdecks, and ASIST technology, but quickly left the field, with a lot of money, and now lives alone in a large house in SF.  He never leaves his house, and everything is delivered.

Walking through the neighborhood, his house is the big on one the bigger lot with the brick wall around it.  Peering through the wrought-iron gate at the driveway, you see a nice big grassy lawn, a two-story brick house, and a guard dog racing towards you.</p>

After a bit of work and hanging out and watching you find that the food deliveries are from the upscale neighborhood grocery, McKroger's.  Hanging around the back, you find some of the delivery guys on break, smoking cigaretts.

You chat with them a bit and talk about stuff, and work the conversation around to Halseth.

"Oh, man, that guy.  Totally wacko.  Whenever he stays in and it's just the butler, I'm always happier to do a drop-off."

"Yeah, same here.  I was delivering yesterday, and the old guy came out, waving his cane and telling me to go back to Skynet.  And then he started wailing on the truck with his cane until the butler dragged him off."

They talk a bit more about the deliveries and then say they have to get back to work.</p>

After a bit of financial discussion (150nY worth), they agree to let you ride along on the next delivery, the next day.

After a bit of matrix work, you find a phone listing for a Billy Pique, in the right city.  You call and, yes, he is her son.  Upon being asked about the penny, he says, "Oh, mom was a big coin collector.  I'm not sure wheer they all came from, but she got a big lot of them back about, oh, 20 years or so ago, from another collector in New York who went bankrupt and had to sell.  What, his name?

Yo eventually get back a name and a phone number and call Lyman Rowzee, the New York collector.

"What? A double-headed 1949 penny? I used to have one, but I sold it years ago.  Call up Laventa Pique, ask her about it."

"Oh, she sold it? Why're you calling me, then?"

"You want to know where I got it? Trying to poach my source, huh?  Well, I'll tell ya, cause it's kinda funny.  About 50 years ago now, this guy comes into my store, old fella even then.  He says he has this lucky penny he wants to sell, cause his son needs the money, yadda yadda.  I gave him some cash for it, and asked where he got it.  He says that he got it back in change from buying a screwdriver! Can you believe it!  Anyway, that's the story, I gotta go, bye."</p>

You call your grandfather back.  He says he might have some of Grampa Albert's notes, he'll take a look and see.

On the appointed day, you show up at McKroger's, hop on the delivery van, and ride around doing deliveries.  Finally, you get to Halspeth's.  The gate opens, the truck drives in, and the two delivery guys hop out and start unloading.  While they put stuff on a cart, a middle-aged man comes out of the house.</p>

"Technology?  Mr. Halseth detests technology, given his history.  I am not sure how you got here, but I do not think you should be bothering him."

Welton begins trying to gesture you back towards the delivery van, as another, much older, man comes out of the house, leaning on a cane.

Halspeth turns back quickly.  "Sarah? You know Sarah!  You can help me!  Soon, Skynet will destroy the world.  I need to destroy it first! But I don't know anything that will totally destroy electronics quickly enough!  Can you help me?"

Welton says, "Sir, he is not serious.  Let's go back inside, and this man can go away and then NOT COME BACK."

Welton leads Halspeth back into the house, closes the door, and then returns.  "Please leave the premises now.  Mr. Halseth is an old man, and his mind was destroyed in an experiment in 2018.  You have no doubt worked him up and now I fear he will do himself harm.  Good day."

Halseth walks back to the door and goes inside.  The delivery guys from McKroger's are standing impatiently by their van.</p>

As you prepare to hand the device to Halseth, you see a faint shape take form behind him.  Transparent, you almost think it's just a heat shimmer, except that it seems to be wearing overalls, and shaking its head at you.

No one else with you can see it, just like they didn't see the penny glowing astrally.</p>

Looking astrally, you're just in time to see the faint shape disappear completely.  The penny is still glowing, but fainter than before.

Looking at Halseth, his aura is much more muted that most.  There's a strong reddish streak that implies a creative mind, and a bluish undertone that seems to say he's very sad most of the time.  Also, there are a few gaps in his skull, places where there's no aura at all.  Most of them, near the surface, are a washed-out grey, but near the center there is a small pitch black patch.

Halseth looks at you, and says, "Oh.  Okay.  When will you be back?"</p>

  <p>Might be a while. 'm gonna have t' find parts. An' 't'll take some work. Least a couple weeks, prob'ly more... 'll be back in a month. 'f 'm done 'r not, 'll let y'know then how much longer it'll be.

<span style="font-style:italic">Let's start the tinkering rolls early:

First, Emvee considers Scrounging for the parts. But some instinct -- Albert? -- tells him that would be a bad idea; this is a not a good time of year to be looking for EMP parts in SF. The pieces for an Intermediate-level pulse generator are 1000nY, so we'll pick them up retail. Moving onto design:

 [shadowrun]  Emvee rolls 6t6: 5 4 4 2 3 2 | 0

Nothing much there. It's a difficult thing to build, so rather than just winging it, we'll call Hex and pass him 500 nY to see if there are any good designs already out there on the Matrix. He gets two successes, so that'll help considerably with building the thing:

 [shadowrun]  Emvee rolls 6t5: 3 5 2 1 2 5 | 2

Success! Within a week, it's ready. It'll probably only hold together for one shot, but it's definitely a pulse generator. I'll try dropping by the Halseth place again during the next delivery time, in the hopes that I'll get lucky and catch him...</span></p>

Showing up and loitering around, you see Halseth come running out the door as soon as the van arrives, only to dejectedly turn back around.  You quickly call his name and he comes over to you.

"Do you have it?"

You hand over the EMP, explaining that it's still one-use only, and he gives you the penny, before running back into his house.</p>

  <p>A month later, watching the news, you see a brief story about an eccentric San Francisco native, formerly a research scientist, whose mental illness was cured after over 40 years of believing he was a character in an old movie from the 20th century.

You receive 2 karma.</p>
