One thing I was wondering - is there a non-national language in 7th Sea? I was thinking how Sophia's Daughters transcend national borders, so the rites shouldn't be in Montaignian, Ussuran, Avalonian, etc, but in whatever the "global" language is. Sort of like how Latin is used in many churches instead of the local language (or is that just a Catholic thing?). Does this make sense?
There's no need to set up an elaborate language, but just a few syllables during the rites to add to the mood.
 
If we are the only two assisting the Handmaiden with the ceremony, then maybe we should stand for something. I don't know, loyalty and death, or something. This is very vague in my head (I just recently read Lady of Avalon, so it's a little muddled with that).</p>

I like your idea of a common language.  Latin is indeed just a catholic thing in terms of religions/denominations, but different arts have their own languages.  For example, piano music uses italian, ballet uses french, and I forget what language chess uses.  The sciences still use latin.  Sophia's Daughters could have one language they favor.   The source book says the Vodacce courtesans form the largest group of the daughters, so maybe Vodacce is the language of choice.
                                                                                
One idea I'm taken with is having some sort of cleansing ritual - perhaps using special bathing salts or oils, putting on special clothes, or even just special under-clothes (some group today wears a special cord under their clothes all the time, I forget whom.  Some off-shoot of Christianity I believe).
                                                                                
Another idea I like is exchanging tokens, or symbols, with the person officiating the rite.  The woman offers up something representing her life before the sisterhood, and receives something representative of Sophia's Daughters.  I dunno, maybe an owl-brooch (for  wisdom), a small book for knowledge, and/or a coin for financial independence.  I'm sure there are all sorts of relevant symbols, for protection, empowerment, and the secret control they (try to) wield.
                                                                                
If we're supposed to stand for something, I definitely agree with loyalty, but maybe something more empowering than death?  Maybe secrecy?  I dunno.
                                                                                
I think this is fun, creating the ritual ourselves. :-)  Its definitely starting to take some shape.</p>

Vodacce would be a fine choice for the ritual language of the Sisters.  If you want to go with the 7th Sea equivalent of Latin, the book calls this 'Thean' (with an accent over the 'e').

I like this idea a lot.  I came up with something for Ketheryna to give that has personal significance to her; if you two want to come up with something of personal significance you can give to her as well, that'd be great.
 
And feel free to keep brainstorming; just chiming in a bit.</p>

I've been thinking some more about the common language thing, and I think I want to go with Vodacce. While I liked the idea of Thean since it's not specific to any country, if I understand the 7th Sea world correctly, Ussura is not a Thean country. That's why we have Mathushka, right? So it wouldn't be right to have a society imposing Thean on Ussurans. Anyway, I like the idea of speaking like courtesans. It would be fun if we can figure out some of the ritual chants to be puns on stuff the courtesans would say. Sort of a secret message hidden behind normal language. But not really. just rituals.
 
The cleansing ritual is a great idea. And if the society was founded by courtesans, then special scented oils, and then a special robe sounds perfect.
 
For exchanging tokens, maybe we can incorporate it with the two-of-us standing for some kind of an idea. How about the Past and Future? The Handmaiden will be the present, but as assistants, we will symbolize the life before the sisterhood, and the loyalty that's now due to the society as her future. And the Handmaiden is like her guide.
 
So Kath will offer up her token symolizing her life to the one that stands for Past. Past accepts the token, does something to it to symbolize that this is now put away (a little like the Corinthians: When I was a child, I spoke like a child. Now that I am an adult, I put away childish toys. Or something. I know I am misquoting. Please don't be offended!).
 
Then the one that's Future presents what stands for the society to Kath. Now, if I am recalling something I read in the player's guide, then Sophia's Daughters is associated with some kind of a knife-school. Because I recall that knife is a special skill associated with SD. I know Era doesn't have the Knife knack, but surely we can say that all members of SD has a special knife they received during their initiation? Maybe there's an owl (for wisdom), or a sun, or some kind of a symbol that we can claim symbolizes the society, carved on the hilt.  So Kath will receive that from Future.
 
(As a side tangent. If a sister ever betrays the sisterhood, her knife is reclaimed and the blade broken.)

So what will be the Handmaiden's role? The Handmaiden will be responsible for accepting Kath - as Past and Future, our job is to just prepare her, but the Handmaiden would be the one to actually accept her into the fold - as Present.

So the sisterhood who will be watching (I assume there's witnesses?) will form some kind of a circle, or an arch. She will walk through that to the center, where the handmaiden awaits, she will already have bathed. She does the Past and Future thing, the Handmaiden uses the special oil to cleanse her, and helps her into the robe, and that's the "Acceptance" into the society?
 
What do you think? Does this sound like it can work?
 
Maybe we can do this at dawn, or dusk, at a "transition" time of the day. Even noon works for me.
 
So now is the most important thing. What are Era and Raelynn going to wear??!?!?!</p>
