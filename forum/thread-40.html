  <p>In response to the <a href="http://www.henchmonkey.org/shadowrun/gm-details.html">GM notes</a> that katre posted:

I thought the initial-mission-complicity thing worked pretty well. Asher isn't really a nice guy as such, but even he felt kind of guilty about, you know, letting weird alien creatures suck out people's brains. The other thing that seemed to work pretty well besides money was equipment, natch -- we were pretty willing to troop all over if it meant getting new magic or whatever. I'm sure if stuff had been different we would have been haring over to Denver for a cyberware upgrade, too.

I liked the Rohm extraction a lot also, especially since it involved, you know, fast talk and knockout gas. Having the barghest at the end was nice since it seemed like we were getting away a little too easily -- it's reassuring to have a big scary monster to let me know that this was not in fact the case (see, then I don't have to worry waiting for the other shoe to drop).

The Lofwyr-blowing-up-his-own-research-station thing is making me laugh and laugh, since yeah, we pretty much assumed they were dumb and let the bugs hit it again. Which just goes to show, uh, something.

Anyway, hmm, overall I had a pretty good time with this campaign. The shadowrun world is nice because it's a good blend of familiar and unfamiliar stuff, and it felt like we travelled around to enough different kinds of places (slums, middle-class, company compounds, tribes, elf-land, roads) and did enough kinds of things (delivery, extraction, robbery, infiltration, assassination) to get a real sampling of the world.

I'm definitely not that sold on the system, though. The equipment-purchasing seems kind of doofy -- I agree it is sort of in-genre for spy missions to be all about the gadgetry, but in practice it feels like none of the specialized equipment is useful all that often, there are only like three guns that are worth using, grenades aren't that powerful, etc. I guess some of this is me not remembering all the stuff that's available, but I don't think that's all of it. The same kind of goes for magic -- I remembered Emvee only using like three spells, which isn't really right when we counted, but I'm pretty sure stunball, invis, heal, and improved reflexes got used way more than anything else. I don't know if this is something that could have been fixed by changing how the combats were set up, or maybe tactical variety just wasn't something people were particularly interested in.

Hmm, what else. I guess overall game-arc was fine -- the Kolmetz thing was a nice call-back near the end of the mission, and otherwise I was pretty happy just to go on random runs and bop around as the fancy (and $) took us. I think the major irritation with this game for me was the irregular play-schedule, but I don't know what can really be done about that, short of screening people at the beginning based on when they can play, and that's kind of lame.</p>

It's kind of interesting that I don't think the complicity really had much affect on Emvee's feelings about taking on Kolmetz. But as I try to trace it back, I think the biggest influence on Emvee's (and I guess my) feelings was actually something that was probably intended as a pretty minor note at the time: the description of Kolmetz's aura when we first met him ([shadowrun] GM says, "It's a disturbing, unnatural, inhuman color"). Which I guess just goes to show that Emvee's a prejudiced little bastard.

That's what I thought the dead-man switch bracelets were... of course, I guess there's no reason for a corp not to keep an extra backup-shoe around.

It goes to show that, like all Shadowrunners eventually must, we came to the conclusion that we were smarter than the corps. (Why else would they need to keep hiring us to help them out?)

Hmm. I think part of it might be that different tools are good for different situations, and that a tool that's good for "disabling a group of enemies quietly" is going to keep being good for that. And so as long as Emvee winds up in combat against people who are susceptible to stun damage, he's got no reason not to pull another stunball out of his sleeve. Likewise with the guns, etc. So maybe throwing us into situations where we couldn't use the techniques we were accustomed to would be useful... except that I guess we'd need to know ahead of time, or else we wouldn't be prepared, and so we wouldn't be able to buy the special gadgets/spells that we needed to make that run interesting. Hmm.

From the notes:

I think the trouble there was that, while you showed how it was compatible with the magic, it wasn't clear how it would be <span style="font-style:italic">useful</span> for it. On the one hand, there was the "woo, chips in my head" cool factor. But on the other hand, there was the question of "so I made a trade-off, giving up X in exchange for ... what?" that I couldn't come up with a good enough answer to. (I think one of the other players -- Gunther, possibly -- might have also made a comment at one point about the cyberware he bought never quite working out to really be worth the price. And that's for someone who didn't need to take on a geas for it.)

I agree that the whole Ancestor Spirit thing and the penny quest rocked. My favorite part of the game, I think. The only thing that I was a bit disappointed in is that we were never able to actually make the foci in that campaign (and, consequently, were never able to use them either). There were a few points where I felt almost like buying one, just so that I could start using it (except that I didn't want to lessen the coolness of the one we were building).

Y'know, it never occurred to me either. Possibly because they were in the next building over.

  <p>Yay GM notes!

Let's see if I can add anything to what's been already said.

As far as player motivation, I also was generally content to go on runs and explore the world.  The complicity thing I was annoyed about, a little, more with the world than with anything in particular (I wasn't annoyed that you as a GM set us up like that, more that the game world was the way it was.  Sort of.  It wasn't a huge deal.)

I did like helping people.  And most of the runs were indeed set up to help people, so that was cool.  The Helen Rohm extraction was my favorite run, too, perhaps in large part because we used my basic idea (make her sick, get her with an ambulance) to get her out.  I remember sort of throwing it out as a lark on the channel, and then inky liked it, so I started trying to figure out how to make it actually work.  In any event, much fun.

Interestingly, getting an ambulance inspired me to try to get an ambulance back in Seattle, too, and run my own EMS program.  Overall, I was actually more interested in that than I was with the Initiation, though in the end it turned into something more interesting as we worked out the details as a group.  So that was cool.

As far as high-preparation runs vs. low-preparation runs, I think I missed a lot of the earlier high-prep runs, but the low-prep ones certainly seemed great to me.  I certainly couldn't tell as a player what was planned in advance and what was dreamed up at the time, so go you ;-)

In the "hmm, I don't really think that way" department, I found it interesting that for many of your runs, it was a big deal for you to introduce us to new mechanics.  "And, most importantly, I wanted to show the magically active members of the group that there were ways they, too, could get cyberware, which would be useful for their magic." for the Helen run, and "I still hadn't figured out how to teach initiation to the group," for what turned into the Portland Roaches run.  For me, still more mechanics I have to deal with are pretty much a curse, and not a blessing.  At least for Shadowrun.  As I read the rules the first time, I latched on to the first character idea I came across because it meant *I didn't have to read any more of the rules*.  I didn't buy a gun so I wouldn't have to read the gun rules, and I didn't buy a vehicle so I wouldn't have to read the vehicle rules.  When I found out that a Shamanist only had to learn a small subset of the spells, I latched on to that in a heartbeat.  The idea of moving to SR4 fills me with a certain amount of dread because the *whole system* is new.  Of course, I never did quite internalize all the SR3 system, so, easy come, easy go.

This is not, I should mention, extremely typical for me.  I usually enjoy learning a new (say) board game, and figuring out how to beat it.  But the sheer volume of the fiddly rules in SR3 and the uneasy feeling that it wasn't actually all that well balanced made me decide, as much as was possible, to focus on a small subset of the (much!) larger set of mechanics, and master that bit.

So from a gaming standpoint, learning the new Initiation rules came for me with a certain amount of "Sigh, OK, I guess I'll figure out how to play yet another subgame in this crazy mixed-up system."  Fortunately, it wasn't horrible, and it ended up inspiring some decent roleplaying aspects, so in the end I was glad of it.  But it's not far away from "Here is an amazingly complex system which you must master and figure out a weird risk-reward system in order to increase a single stat by one."  Good lord, can I just spend my XP already?

(And I confess a certain amount of the same feeling about the astral projection.  Although with AP I was seriously considering being a full-blooded mage so I could do that, and finally decided it wasn't worth the cost in a) less points for spells, b) less points for skills, and c) more time reading more rules.  Now that the cost is only c), I may go ahead and take it ;-)

I dunno how other people feel about this; I may well be somewhat ideosyncratic in this regard.  

Moving on in a somewhat scattershot fasion...

Hmm, the orks.  Here's basically what went through my mind when we found them:  "????!  What they heck are they *doing* here?  Are they guards?  No, I guess probably not.  They must be the luckiest guys alive to make it here without disturbing the Invae next door.  Sheesh, if we tell them to run, they'll a) probably not believe us, and b) probably get found by the Invae guards.  They seem to be safe enough for now, and if we succeed, they'll be safe afterwards, too."  &lt;backs away slowly&gt; &lt;shuts the door&gt;.

Interestingly, I didn't feel particularly protective of them, though I can see why you would think I would from my sheet and all.  Part of it is that I guess I tend not to think of teenagers old enough to watch porn on their own in an abandoned part of the city as 'kids'.  If you had called them '13-year-olds' that probably would have twigged my protective reflex, and then I would have openly angsted about it for a bit before deciding they were safest where they were ;-)

And yeah, I'm totally up for a bit of denoument where I finally make Emvee's focus, and do a forum-based run to Colorado for (perhaps) Sunny's betaware, and my rock.   Mmmm, rock.</p>

I guess I never particularly came out and said this (and never really formally thought it to myself), but I saw this campaign as "ifMUD's Introduction to Shadowrun".  So I tried to vary things up and show a lot of places.  I tied to show a lot of different types of runs.  And I tried to keep bringing out the cool new stuff that you could learn that isn't in the core rules (betaware, initiation, geasa, etc.  If we'd had more time, I would have brought in bioware, too).  I'm very aware that this is the first ifMUD Shadowrun campaign, and I wanted to sort of showcase the game world and show what can be done in it.

The good news with SR4 is that the rules are a lot more unified.  Instead of ranged combat being one thing, and melee combat another, and magic yet a third, etc etc, it's all the same core mechanic.  Still with lots of fiddly modifiers, though.  It wouldn't be Shadowrun without the fiddly modifiers.</p>

  <p>Oh, this seems as good a time as any to admit that, even though he'd be unlikely to admit it, Emvee's nickname is actually spelled "mV".</p>

  <p>I think the campaign went pretty well as a whole.  In the finale, the feeling of "oh crap we're surrounded, but maybe we can manage to get to a good spot to use the bomb" was pretty awesome.

So if SK decided to stop bothering with us, were they planning to deal with the spreading Invae problem themselves, or avoid them and move out of town, or wait and see what we do on our own?  I hope the Dragon is at least sticking it back to AzTech.

I'm wondering how people felt about Istereth being essentially only good with drones, always staying behind and sending some machine along.  It feels a bit selfish to frequently be the one not in direct mortal danger (though maybe PC deckers are similar).  And then at Jim's, there was little I could do but run screaming for the door.  (Instinct says, when in trouble, get to the truck.)  But I guess given enough of this sort of thing, a GM would set up a surprise attack on the truck or something fun like that.</p>

I don't know about anyone else, but I had no problem with going on runs with Spider. If you were an NPC, we might try to use it as an excuse to reduce your share, but that's a different matter entirely.</p>

  <p>Likewise on the only-drone-presence.  It's actually reassuring to know at least one member of the team might possibly survive some of the foolish things we try.

Also, replying back to katre from a while back, that makes more sense about 'introducing the MUD to Shadowrun.  And I liked the variety of runs we went on, too.

I admit to a certain amount of surprise that the warren was so extensively mapped.  Once we got in it and saw things running away to tell folks we were there, I figured if we stopped for any amount of time at all we'd just get swarmed and destroyed.  If the power cable *hadn't* led to Kolmetz, I think I might have despaired of ever getting out of there alive ;-)</p>
